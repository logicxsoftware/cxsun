# Changelog

## Version State

Current version: 1.0.81

Release tag: v-1.0.81

Changelog label: v 1.0.81

This changelog starts fresh from the cleaned CODEXSUN foundation. Earlier copied application history was intentionally removed because it did not represent the current workspace.

New entries should keep database-facing work and application code work separate.

#### Database Changes

Records schema, migration, seed, tenant provisioning, and data compatibility changes.

#### App Codebase Changes

Records UI, API, service logic, tooling, packaging, and documentation changes.

## v-1.0.81

### [v 1.0.81] 2026-10-10 12:35 pm - Frappe enquiry sources, CRM workflows, and shared UI

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Added tenant `frappe_data_sources` to store the selected provider for CRM enquiries. New rows default to the local provider.
- Existing tenant databases need the Frappe data source migration before the provider setting can be used. No database migration was run as part of this version update.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.81.
- Added source-aware CRM enquiry routes and a paged live Frappe enquiry list for all, assigned, and created views.
- Show HTML-formatted enquiry titles and details as plain text in local and Frappe CRM tables without changing stored content.
- Reordered the CRM sidebar to put Contact and Enquiries after Overview, and changed the Reports menu label to List in.
- Grouped Contact 360, My Job, My Calls, and Common under a new On Research CRM sidebar menu.
- Added a tenant setting to select local or verified Frappe data for CRM enquiry lists. CRM reports still read local records and show that scope in the UI.
- Added paged Frappe enquiry preview and a queued import of unlinked enquiries with job progress, skip counts, and failure details.
- Expanded the shared UI library with workspace, agent, content, and commerce blocks, new components and themes, and matching UIUX gallery pages. Updated UI dependencies and the root lockfile.
- Updated Mermaid to 12.1.0 and pinned patched KaTeX and lodash-es transitive dependencies. Updated the demo build and API images to npm 12.2.0; the dependency audit now reports zero findings.
- Updated the Windows app manifests and deployment sample to the new lockstep version. No release tag or deployment was created.
- Passed version alignment, dependency layout, add-on, workspace TypeScript, lint, CRM and Frappe module boundaries, and 13 focused Frappe tests. The full repository check stops at the existing Zetro admin module boundary, which lacks five required frontend role files.

## v-1.0.80

### [v 1.0.80] 2026-10-06 11:52 pm - Project Manager, CRM, auditor, and UI updates

#### Database Changes

- Added CRM enquiry backfills for existing descriptions, activity, and List In, Status, and Priority references.
- Added Project Manager Ideas and activity tables for Super Admin idea tracking.
- Transferred Platform Registry table ownership from DevKit to Project Manager without copying records. Existing database upgrade and rollback must be verified before deployment.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Replaced the DevKit host with the Super Admin Project Manager package and kept it out of tenant app navigation.
- Added the Project Manager Ideas API and workspace with status, category, assignee, and archive actions.
- Added CRM enquiry work, comments, reference workspaces, contact lookup, and HTML comment sanitization.
- Added encrypted Auditor portal credentials with separate view, update, and reveal permissions and audit events.
- Added tenant user role choices and role assignment when creating or editing a user.
- Expanded shared UI layouts, interface topology controls, and the UIUX gallery.
- Registered the CRM and Auditor API packages in production artifact resolution and extended migration checks to DevKit sources.
- Passed workspace checks, production build, migration and deployment contracts, production API smoke, and focused credential and Project Manager tests.

### [v 1.0.80] 2026-10-06 6:21 pm - CXSUN identity migration and CRM contacts navigation

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual). Deployment database names, users, service names, and volume names changed to CXSUN defaults. Existing deployments must map their data and credentials before upgrade; no table schema rewrite is included.
- Kept the recorded DevKit migration checksum stable so existing databases can continue through the migration ledger.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.80.
- Renamed internal packages, environment keys, runtime identifiers, container resources, and tooling from CXApp to CXSUN.
- Added CRM Contacts navigation and an overview action that opens Core's existing Contact workspace and API.
- Kept Leads and Deals as planned CRM modules without adding new data screens or database tables.
- Clarified single-client and multi-tenant setup in `.env.example` and documented Core Contact ownership in the module boundaries.
- Set `CODEXSUN/cxsun` as the active repository and Windows release source.
- Added a UIUX gallery workspace for shared design foundations, layouts, workspace blocks, and components.

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.73.
- Routed quotation-to-sales conversion through Sales-owned automatic invoice reservation instead of reusing a preformatted quotation-flow number.
- Consolidated combined quotation lines only when item identity, rate, and description match; different lines remain separate and only matching quantities are added.
- Normalized persisted Billing numbering settings and next-number calculations to start at 1, preventing negative automatic numbers across sales, quotation, purchase, export sales, payment, and receipt flows.
- Verified Billing API typecheck, lint, version alignment, and whitespace checks.

- Added Bill-wise, Month-wise, and Year-wise table view controls to the same six lists.
- Kept Bill-wise as the normal document table. Month-wise and Year-wise replace its rows with grouped taxable, GST, amount, and document-count totals.
- Kept payment and receipt grouped columns aligned with their Amount and Allocated values.
- Removed the expanded totals panel and its duplicate table so each page shows one list table at a time.

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (auto-check).
- Added Accounts migration v6 to rename every supported legacy `acc_*` table to its module-owned `accounts_*` name.
- Kept already-applied v1 migration checksums stable and added a v2 standard-column pass after the rename, so existing migration ledgers remain valid.
- Normalized migrated Accounts status columns to `VARCHAR(24)` and backfilled required standard identity and audit columns through the existing safe helper.
- The upgrade refuses to run when a legacy and current table pair coexist, preventing an implicit merge or data loss.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.69.
- Updated Accounts repositories, seeders, and end-to-end assertions to use the `accounts_*` ownership prefix for all new and upgraded schemas.
- Extended the migration contract gate to recognize `accounts_` as a tenant-database module owner prefix.
- Preserved duplicate-key retry compatibility for legacy named database constraints during the transition.
- Verified fresh Accounts migration, a disposable legacy-prefix upgrade, Accounts typecheck and lint, migration contracts, and module boundaries.

## v-1.0.68

### [v 1.0.68] 2026-09-02 8:56 pm - Billing address reactivity and Core form input handling

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Restored File Manager's owner database startup and repeatable migration flow.

- Allowed spaces in Contact codes during typing and converted them to uppercase hyphenated codes during save.
- Added regression tests for Sales Contact reactivity and Company and Contact save-time text normalization.

## v-1.0.67

### [v 1.0.67] 2026-08-25 2:05 pm - update latest npm packages and tenant domain resolver

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (auto-check).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.67.

## v-1.0.66

### [v 1.0.66] 2026-08-25 1:56 pm - Multi-domain tenant isolation and dependency hardening

- Added the missing `@cxsun/framework/addons` runtime export wrapper and verified the add-on lifecycle contract.
- Preserved `app.codexsun.com` as the shared Corporate-ID domain while allowing individually verified tenant domains to authenticate without a redundant Corporate ID prompt.
- Added versioned tenant-specific JWT signing-key derivation so platform, ALTEX, COTTON, and other tenant tokens use cryptographically isolated keys.
- Continued binding authenticated sessions to the exact login hostname and retained host-only production cookies for parallel tenant sessions in one browser.
- Keyed tenant database pools and new tenant storage roots by immutable tenant UUID, with protection against cross-tenant database ownership collisions.
- Hardened add-on activation cleanup errors by preserving their underlying causes.
- Added focused tenant-key isolation tests and verified all workspace typechecks, lint tasks, production builds, dependency checks, and add-on contract tests.

## v-1.0.64

### [v 1.0.64] 2026-08-20 10:42 am - Accounts security and workspace hardening

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.64.
- Enforced Accounts permissions for view, create, update, delete, lifecycle, and posting actions.
- Bound Accounts actor identity to the request scope and recorded authenticated users in accounting audit fields.
- Made journal line allocation and journal posting transaction-safe for concurrent requests.
- Added automatic `JV-######` journal numbering when the entry number is blank.
- Kept company and financial-year browser context session-scoped to prevent stale tenant context after login changes.
- Verified Accounts API/web typechecks, module boundaries, and accounting E2E flows.
- Repaired the root npm workspace installation so `@cxsun/accounts-api` and `@cxsun/accounts-web` resolve through the
  single root `node_modules` tree during Platform startup.
- Updated every external npm dependency to the latest registry release, including React 19.2, TanStack Table 9,

- Overrode the vulnerable transitive `deepmerge-ts` release with compatible version 8.0.1; `npm audit` now reports
  zero known vulnerabilities and the Mail HTML-to-text parser smoke test passes.
- Verified all workspace typechecks, lint, module boundaries, production builds, dependency layout, version
  alignment, and live Platform API startup with Accounts routes and a healthy `/health` response.

## v-1.0.63

## v-1.0.62

### [v 1.0.62] 2026-08-16 12:20 pm - Windows update feed registration

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.62.
- Replaced the timeout-prone update-feed reinstall with direct Windows package auto-update settings
  registration after the signed MSIX is installed.
- Added post-registration checks for the App Installer URI, launch-time update checks, and the
  automatic background update task.
- Kept App Installer deployment as the compatibility fallback on Windows versions that do not expose
  the direct update-settings command.
- Replaced the WinUI 3/.NET 10 host with a Tauri 2/Rust host that reuses the Platform React login and
  desk through the installed WebView2 runtime.
- Preserved the existing `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CXSUN\Desktop\workspace.db` projection and added Rust
  validation plus WAL-backed SQLite tests for canonical tenant identity data.
- Restricted desktop navigation to local launcher content and `https://app.codexsun.com`, kept
  Corporate ID visible and mandatory, and exposed only the safe workspace-projection bridge.
- Replaced MSIX/App Installer release assembly with a current-user NSIS installer, Windows
  Authenticode signing, Tauri updater signatures, a GitHub `latest.json` feed, checksums, install,
  uninstall, and WinUI migration scripts.
- Added a separate updater signing identity and GitHub Actions secret contract. Node.js remains the
  cloud runtime and build tool and is not shipped as a permanent desktop sidecar.
- Verified the Tauri development host in the real Windows UI: one responsive CXSUN window rendered
  the cloud login with Corporate ID, Email, Password, Forgot password, and Sign in controls.

## v-1.0.61

### [v 1.0.61] 2026-08-16 11:57 am - Windows framework runtime activation

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.61.
- Superseded 1.0.60 after the installed package failed before application startup with WinUI
  activation error `0x80040111`.
- Declared the Windows host as an MSIX application and changed the package to the supported
  framework-dependent Windows App SDK deployment model.
- Added the Microsoft-signed x64 Windows App Runtime package to every release, checksum manifest,
  GitHub release, App Installer dependency graph, and verified installer path.
- Restored `XamlControlsResources` so WinUI and WebView2 controls resolve their theme resources at
  runtime.
- Kept direct signed-package installation authoritative and made update-feed registration
  non-destructive when the remote GitHub feed is temporarily unavailable.

## v-1.0.60

### [v 1.0.60] 2026-08-16 11:38 am - Windows packaged runtime activation

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.60.
- Superseded the 1.0.59 Windows package after installed-runtime verification showed that it still
  stopped before the WebView2 control reached its loaded state.
- Replaced manual MSIX assembly with the supported Windows App SDK packaging target so the package
  includes the generated `resources.pri`, WinUI activation metadata, and WebView2 registration as
  one validated contract.
- Added the Windows package manifest to lockstep version updates and `check:versions`; release tags
  can no longer publish a package whose identity version differs from the workspace version.
- Changed the release installer to download and validate the signed MSIX, force an in-place update,
  register the App Installer update feed, and verify the exact installed release version.
- Replaced the packaging checksum cmdlet dependency with a direct SHA-256 implementation that works
  consistently in Windows PowerShell and GitHub Actions.

## v-1.0.59

### [v 1.0.59] 2026-08-16 11:18 am - Windows runtime launch fix

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.59.
- Fixed installed Windows startup by adding the WebView2 in-process COM registration required by
  the MSIX package contract.
- Aligned the .NET 10 host target with the current Windows 10 SDK contract while keeping Windows
  10 version 2004 as the minimum supported client version.
- Delayed WebView2 startup until its WinUI control is loaded and removed the redundant direct
  WebView2 NuGet reference supplied by the Windows App SDK.
- Added bounded local startup diagnostics under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\CXSUN\Desktop\startup.log` so a
  packaged launch failure can be diagnosed without exposing tenant credentials or session tokens.
- Kept the current Windows release scoped to tenant enrollment and the canonical cloud workspace;
  offline Billing runtime and synchronization remain later release gates.

## v-1.0.58

### [v 1.0.58] 2026-08-16 9:37 am - Windows installer and automatic updates

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.58.
- Added the x64 WinUI 3 and .NET 10 Windows host with WebView2, a safe tenant workspace bridge, and
  device-local SQLite enrollment state.
- Added deterministic MSIX packaging, CXSUN package icons, SHA-256 checksums, current-user install
  and uninstall commands, and stable App Installer release assets.
- Added a GitHub Actions release workflow for `v-<version>` tags. It rejects version/tag mismatch,
  validates the source, builds the Windows host, signs the MSIX, and publishes the release assets.
- Required the `CXSUN_WINDOWS_SIGNING_PFX` and `CXSUN_WINDOWS_SIGNING_PASSWORD` repository secrets.
  The release stops before publication if the trusted signing identity is unavailable.
- Connected App Installer launch and background update checks to stable assets under the latest
  CODEXSUN/cxsun GitHub release.
- Added a first-release installer that validates and trusts the private CODEXSUN sideloading
  certificate for the current user before it installs the automatic-update feed.
- Added the public signing certificate and install/uninstall scripts to the release assets. The
  private certificate stays only in GitHub Actions secrets.
- Added administrator elevation to trust the self-signed release certificate in the machine root
  and trusted-people stores. Windows AppX requires machine trust for this private certificate.
- Changed CI verification to match the MSIX signer thumbprint against the generated public
  certificate. This avoids an interactive root-trust prompt on the GitHub runner.
- Cleared SignTool's handled untrusted-root exit code after the signer thumbprint check so the
  private sideloading release can continue to GitHub publication.
- Made GitHub publication replace assets when a release tag is rebuilt. A failed installer fix can
  now update the same release without creating a duplicate release.
- Updated the GitHub checkout, Node.js setup, and .NET setup actions to their current runtimes. This
  removes the deprecated Node.js 20 action warning from the Windows release.
- Documented the one-tenant offline-first target, cloud control-plane boundary, release process, and
  current limitation: the Windows host is an enrollment foundation until the local runtime and
  module-owned synchronization implementations are complete.

## v-1.0.57

### [v 1.0.57] 2026-08-13 2:01 am - Development restart and deployment compatibility

- Kept the sibling process available during an API or web restart.
- Added a graceful child shutdown request with a three-second forced-stop fallback.
- Limited restart loops to five attempts within 30 seconds.
- Kept backend source and `.env` watching in the API process.
- Kept frontend hot reload and configuration restart behavior in Vite.
- Retained `npm run dev:api` and `npm run dev:web` for separate local development processes.
- Added contract tests for independent restarts and graceful shutdown order.
- Verified both restart directions live with HTTP 200 responses on ports 7010 and 7020.
- Documented the combined and separate local development commands.
- Added DevKit API and Web packages to the production container build and runtime images.
- Replaced the host deployment-file bind with an image-owned empty `.env` and Compose runtime variables.
- Updated the deployment smoke test to use the `tenants` table and configured default tenant identity.
- Added `mariadb-dump --no-defaults` to prevent host or container client settings from changing backups.
- Added deployment contract tests for the container environment, backup, tenant table, and tenant identity rules.

## v-1.0.56

### [v 1.0.56] 2026-08-11 6:29 pm - Application company branding

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.56.
- Used the Application Company legal name as the public home and desk brand name.
- Used the Company name when the legal name is empty.
- Connected the public tenant home, tenant desk, Billing desk, and document header to the Company logos.
- Added a tenant-resolved public logo route for the Application Company.
- Scoped new logo files by Company ID and kept a read fallback for old tenant-wide logo files.
- Fixed logo upload and read requests for HttpOnly cookie sessions.
- Checked Company access before upload and read operations.
- Disabled logo upload until the Company record exists and removed placeholder logo paths.
- Updated the tenant access test for the Company-scoped logo route.
- Documented the Storage Manager Company logo routes and storage rules.

## v-1.0.55

### [v 1.0.55] 2026-08-07 9:46 am - Super Admin session recovery

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.55.
- Added the public `/sa/refresh` route for recovery when an invalid tenant session holds the Super Admin desk loader.
- Added `/auth/session/reset` to revoke the current server session and clear current and legacy authentication cookies.
- Cleared browser tenant context and query caches before redirecting to a fresh Super Admin login.
- Allowed public login and reset routes to continue without tenant validation after the server validates the base session claims.
- Added focused tests for the public reset path and the refreshed-session login message.
- Rejected partial numeric prefixes in tenant, tenant-domain, and version parsing to prevent wrong-record selection.
- Changed tenant-domain update and verification routes to use public UUIDs instead of internal numeric IDs.
- Documented Testing Lab software as a separate tenant-activated add-on that uses Billing only through public contracts.

## v-1.0.54

### [v 1.0.54] 2026-08-05 6:45 pm - GST statement tabs and separate printing

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.54.
- Moved the monthly GST filing fields into a dedicated `Filed details` tab, keeping the Sales,
  Purchase, HSN, and reconciliation reports together under the `GST statement` tab.
- Added independent Sales and Purchase print actions that render only the selected document and HSN
  report while retaining the combined GST Statement print option.
- Separated Sales and Purchase HSN-wise reports into their own card row and stretched both document
  report panels to the same height for a stable two-column comparison.
- Added reversible row visibility checkboxes to both document reports, recalculated the moved bottom
  totals from visible rows only, and aligned scoped printing with the visible document selection.
- Fixed the shared print-sheet root so Sales and Purchase GST print actions render their selected
  report tables instead of exposing the embedded print stylesheet as page text.

## v-1.0.53

### [v 1.0.53] 2026-08-05 6:10 pm - Mail settings and fallback reliability

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (`billing.reports.gst-statement.filing-v1`).
- Added company, financial-year, year, and month-scoped GST filing persistence for the opening GST
  balance plus GSTR-1 and GSTR-3B ARN numbers and filed dates.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.53.
- Reorganized the tenant Mail settings dialog into shared spring-animated Outbound, Inbound, and
  Test delivery tabs while preserving entered values across tab changes and keeping Save/Cancel
  controls fixed in the dialog footer.
- Fixed stale environment SMTP fallback configuration during local development by making the API
  watcher observe the root `.env` file and letting each restarted API child reload current mail
  credentials instead of inheriting the watcher's original `.env` snapshot.
- Confirmed the normal Mail queue fallback flow against Hostinger SMTP: the controlled delivery
  completed on its first attempt through the environment provider and persisted the returned
  provider message ID on the sent Mail record.
- Reworked GST Statement into a monthly filing workspace with month/year controls, side-by-side
  Sales/Outward and Purchase/Inward document registers, contact GSTIN, mixed tax-rate visibility,
  invoice totals, and separate HSN/product summaries derived from confirmed Billing documents.
- Added the GST reconciliation formula `opening balance + Sales GST - Purchase GST = balance`,
  editable filed-return details, and a filing-oriented print layout containing both document and HSN
  reports plus GSTR-1/GSTR-3B ARN status.

## v-1.0.52

### [v 1.0.52] 2026-08-05 5:30 pm - Billing activity separator

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (`mail.hostinger-provider-v1`).
- Added encrypted Hostinger Mail API token and mailbox resource ID fields to tenant Mail settings.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.52.
- Replaced the malformed activity timeline separator with `@` in Sales, Quotation, Purchase, and
  Export Sales show pages.
- Added Hostinger Mail API as a tenant-selectable outbound provider, including encrypted token
  persistence, mailbox resource selection, queued delivery, and Base64 PDF attachment support while
  retaining SMTP and environment fallback behavior.

## v-1.0.51

### [v 1.0.51] 2026-08-01 11:22 am - Independent compliance and normal text entry

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.51.
- Made Sales E-invoice and E-way behavior independent: Billing settings now support either feature
  alone, each form section has its own persisted Clear operation, and clearing one compliance record
  leaves the other untouched.
- Tightened Sales print visibility so acknowledgement fields require a non-empty IRN and E-way date
  requires a non-empty E-way bill number; E-way-only documents print without enabling E-invoice.
- Expanded focused MariaDB coverage for E-invoice-only and E-way-only persistence, independent clear
  endpoints, database-row removal, and the print visibility contract.
- Restored normal trailing-space typing and caret behavior for Company and Contact legal names,
  second address lines, and bank holder names while trimming those values only when saving.
- Hydrated contact GSTIN into Quotation, Sales, Purchase, and Export Sales document responses and
  rendered it in every Bill-to and Ship-to show/print preview, with real MariaDB coverage across all
  four document types, and tightened the GSTIN/UIN and State Name label-to-value spacing.
- Added each product's GST percentage to the Quotation, Sales, Purchase, and Export Sales
  autocomplete dropdown labels while preserving the clean product name when selected and saved.
- Replaced the simulated Billing Entry tools PDF toast with real multi-copy PDF generation,
  tenant-scoped Queue Management tracking, browser download, Mail-queued PDF attachments, and a
  new-tab WhatsApp handoff that downloads the PDF and clearly requires the user to attach and send it.

## v-1.0.50

### [v 1.0.50] 2026-08-01 10:50 am - Persist Sales compliance drafts

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (`billing.sales.compliance-drafts-v1`).
- Added a forward, tenant-scoped Billing migration that allows draft E-invoice IRNs and E-way
  bill numbers/dates to remain empty while preserving generated-document uniqueness, and stores
  E-way transporter name and GST snapshots for reliable reloads.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.50.
- Persisted E-invoice and E-way draft details inside the same transaction as normal Sale create and
  update operations, preventing transport, vehicle, date, notes, acknowledgement, IRN, and signed-QR
  input from disappearing after Save or reload.
- Added focused MariaDB persistence coverage for compliance draft creation, direct table rows,
  editing, API reload, and Billing database connection restart through
  `npm run test:e2e:sales-compliance`.

## v-1.0.49

### [v 1.0.49] 2026-08-01 10:12 am - Billing adaptive document printing

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.49.
- Locked quotation, sales, purchase, and export-sales item prints to one Billing-owned adaptive pagination contract: 13-15 items retain the 12-plus-remainder layout, larger documents balance 12-15 items on the first page, middle pages hold up to 12, and continuation/final pages retain at least 4 items whenever redistribution is possible.
- Standardized the four print item tables with unrestricted product/description wrapping, indented valid Colour/Size details, three-line item slots, missing-item-only line reservations, darker table borders, calculated page and carried-forward totals, and explicit continuation markers.
- Expanded receiver and authorised-signature space, kept compact A4 totals and footers, and made Sales e-invoice print metadata render persisted IRN, acknowledgement, and E-Way Bill values only when each value is present.

## v-1.0.48

### [v 1.0.48] 2026-08-01 7:21 am - Billing quotation and sales list cleanup

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.48.
- Removed the contact-filter card from the Billing Quotation list while preserving quotation
  search, status filtering, column controls, row selection, invoice generation, totals, and
  pagination.
- Removed the unused select-all and per-row multi-select controls from the Billing Sales list,
  including their local selection state and handlers, while preserving print controls, row actions,
  totals, and pagination.
- Removed the supplier contact-filter card from the Billing Purchase list while preserving purchase
  search, status filtering, multi-select invoice generation, totals, and pagination.
- Added a persisted Billing Settings Work order layout toggle with backward-compatible defaults and conditional work-order controls in quotation, sales, and purchase forms. Receipt and payment currently have no work-order field/API contract to toggle.
- Ported Billing Stack show/print enhancements into CXSUN quotation, sales, and purchase: configurable document titles, shared letterhead headers, address-mode layouts, bank details, amount-in-words, signature/footer sections, compact totals, richer feedback, and sales e-invoice print details.
- Tuned quotation, sales, and purchase print item tables with product/description on the first Particulars line, valid Colour/Size values on a dedicated second line, wider particulars columns, darker borders, balanced item-row spacing with a larger first-row top buffer, tighter blank rows, and compact totals and footer sections.
- Reworked quotation, sales, and purchase A4 pagination to fit up to 20 items on the first page and 12 items on each continuation page, retain the 12-row blank reservation for short final pages, and prevent signatures or jurisdiction footers from spilling onto an extra sheet.
- Added calculated page totals, cumulative carried-forward totals, and explicit "To be continued" markers to multi-page Billing prints; removed duplicate Colour/Size columns because valid values are already rendered in the wider Particulars column.
- Updated Sales e-invoice print details to render persisted IRN, Ack No., Ack Date, E-Way Bill No., and E-Way Bill Date independently, omitting both the label and value whenever a field is empty.
- Standardized quotation, sales, and purchase print item slots to a three-line reserved height across the 12-row final-page pattern, including matching dummy rows, and indented Colour/Size beneath the primary particulars line.
- Refined Billing print pagination with unrestricted particulars wrapping, Colour/Size on the following indented line, line-budgeted placeholders only for missing item slots, and a taller receiver/authorised-signature area instead of trailing dummy lines. Invoices with 13-15 items retain the 12-plus-remainder split; larger invoices balance 12-15 items on the first page, up to 12 on middle pages, and at least 4 on continuation/final pages whenever the document size permits.
- Locked Export Sales item printing to the same adaptive Billing pattern as quotation, sales, and purchase, including balanced page sizes, wider wrapping particulars, indented Colour/Size, line-budgeted missing slots, calculated page/carried-forward totals, and continuation markers.

## v-1.0.47

### [v 1.0.47] 2026-07-31 5:58 pm - Harden browser and module session handling

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).
- Replaced per-record Billing list hydration with module-owned batch reads for quotation, sales,
  purchase, export sales, payment, and receipt documents. A 100-row Sales or Export Sales page now
  uses five bounded statements instead of up to 302 queued statements, without changing schemas or
  response contracts.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped the synchronized workspace version to 1.0.47.
- Hardened browser session expiry handling so only the explicit `AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED` contract
  clears local context and redirects to login; domain, permission, validation, and upstream lookup
  authorization failures remain visible without destroying a valid session.
- Made active encrypted session cookies take precedence over retired browser bearer tokens while
  preserving bearer JWT propagation for authenticated loopback module-to-Core requests.
- Standardized missing and invalid Framework authentication as `AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED`, allowing
  ordinary protected routes—not only `/auth/session`—to recover consistently when a cookie expires
  or disappears.
- Removed Mail's legacy local-storage JWT usage, restored session-scoped tenant context reads, and
  enabled credentialed cookie requests for the Mail API.
- Added focused regression coverage for cookie-versus-bearer selection, trusted loopback bearer
  forwarding, explicit expiry classification, and non-session 401 preservation.
- Confirmed fresh login clears browser session context, replaces every current or legacy session
  cookie, revokes the previously presented server session, and added lifecycle coverage proving the
  retired cookie is rejected while the new cookie remains authenticated.
- Added the Cloudflare MariaDB tunnel runbook for server routing, new Windows client installation,
  SQLyog configuration, verification, reconnection, and troubleshooting.
- Hardened CXSUN Docker updates with source-to-image version matching, an exclusive host lock,
  explicit migration compatibility approval, dirty-worktree control, disk-space preflight,
  SHA-256 backup verification and retention, plus per-attempt deployment audit metadata.
- Debounced and cancellation-wired all Billing transaction searches, ran page and count reads in
  parallel, retained prior page data during refresh, and removed the forced Billing-settings reload
  from New Sale and New Export Sale.
- Added bounded React Query freshness and cache lifetimes, disabled expensive focus-triggered
  refetches, and assigned longer freshness to tenant runtime, company/year context, and Billing
  settings while keeping mutation invalidation authoritative.
- Added idle Billing workspace preloading and immutable hashed-asset caching so first navigation pays
  less chunk latency while visible layouts and module flows remain unchanged.
- Added an authenticated lightweight route for automatic quotation, sales, purchase, and export
  sales printing. Hidden print frames now restore trusted session company/year context and load only
  the owning Billing print module instead of booting the complete tenant desk; ordinary print-page
  navigation and printed output remain unchanged.
- Consolidated repeated quotation, sales, purchase, and export-sales master reads into Billing-owned,
  company-scoped lookup cache keys with bounded freshness. Switching forms now reuses matching live
  contacts, products, work orders, address data, and product masters while existing create/edit
  refetches keep the shared cache authoritative and prevent cross-company reuse. Lookup requests
  also wait for the trusted company context instead of issuing an initial context-free request.
- Mounted the shared global loader before the initial runtime-configuration request and contained
  lazy tenant workspace fallbacks inside the existing desk shell. Sidebar and record navigation now
  uses React transitions so a late module chunk no longer replaces an already-visible page with a
  full-screen loader.

## v-1.0.46

### [v 1.0.46] 2026-07-31 2:26 pm - Manual Tenant Database Lifecycle and User Manager

#### Database Changes

- Removed automatic tenant database provisioning and re-installation from tenant create and edit.
  Tenant identity, connection settings, domains, enabled applications, and portal content now save
  to the Platform database independently of the tenant database lifecycle.
- Made tenant database inspection operator-driven. Opening a tenant no longer connects, installs,
  or migrates its database; Check connection, New setup, Re-install, and Safe migrate remain
  explicit manual actions.
- Added exact offline connection details plus applied migration versions to tenant database status
  and show pages, and registered the tenant Task Manager migration through its module-owned ledger.
- Database update: Manual only. Existing installed tenants can use Safe migrate; uninstalled tenants
  require New setup when the operator is ready.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped the synchronized workspace version to 1.0.46.
- Added Super Admin Tenant Setup -> User Manager navigation with an explicit tenant selector,
  isolated tenant-user listing, create and edit forms, lifecycle controls, validation, and
  persistence coverage against the selected tenant database.
- Replaced generic tenant-user database failures with actionable setup or credential-reference
  errors, and disabled automatic query retries for unavailable tenant databases.
- Fixed production company saves with an industry selected by replacing the domain-sensitive
  loopback HTTP validation call with an injected Platform-owned industry lookup contract.
- Fixed New Sale redirecting valid users to session-expired login: authenticated module-to-Core
  lookup calls over the local Platform API are now recognized as trusted loopback bearer requests,
  while the browser clears login state only for the explicit `AUTH_SESSION_EXPIRED` response code.
- Confirmed tenant logins are independent session records, so signing in on another computer does
  not revoke an existing computer's session.
- Changed absent company logo variants from filesystem-backed 500 errors to the existing
  `COMPANY_LOGO_NOT_FOUND` 404 response understood by the company form.
- Added inline progress spinners and processing labels to New setup and Re-install controls.
- Migrated Platform and shared UI charts to Recharts 3, added the compatible React dependency, and
  updated tooltip and legend typings to the Recharts 3 API.
- Expanded tenant database and access regression coverage for manual provisioning, migration state,
  cross-tenant isolation, Super Admin user create/edit persistence, cleanup, and unavailable
  database error reporting.

## v-1.0.45

### [v 1.0.45] 2026-07-31 8:54 am - Tenant Task Manager Live Persistence

#### Database Changes

- Added module-owned Task Manager tables, indexes, lookup defaults, and
  rollback wiring to enabled tenant databases while preserving the separate
  Super Admin scope in the Platform database.
- Added the protected `platform.task-manager.access` tenant permission and
  tenant-specific scope keys so todos and lookups remain isolated even inside
  their owning database.
- Enabled and provisioned Task Manager for the CODEXSUN tenant in
  `codexsun_db`; the live tenant now has active module settings, both Task
  Manager tables, and all 14 default lookup records.
- Database update: Yes (tenant migration and seed required).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.45.
- Added Task Manager to the tenant app registry, breadcrumb app switcher,
  landing choices, and tenant desk navigation with Overview and Todo entries.
- Routed the shared Task Manager workspace through desk-aware API calls and
  database-injected services, with enabled-module and role-permission checks
  for tenant requests.
- Added request validation plus live regression coverage for platform and
  tenant restart persistence, two-database isolation, default seeding, and
  rollback cleanup.

## v-1.0.44

### [v 1.0.44] 2026-07-30 11:29 pm - DevKit Platform Registry Consolidation

#### Database Changes

- Migrated Super Admin Task Manager todos and lookup values from runtime JSON
  persistence to module-owned `task_manager_todos` and
  `task_manager_lookups` Platform MariaDB tables with integer identities,
  8-character UUIDs, audit fields, indexes, and repeatable default lookup
  seeding. Existing Task Manager JSON files are imported idempotently as
  read-only legacy input.
- Retired the process-memory queue backend. Existing `memory` runtime settings
  and environment values safely normalize to the durable database queue, while
  BullMQ with Redis remains available for distributed processing.
- Replaced Billing's process-memory domain-event and queue arrays with
  tenant-owned `billing_domain_events` and `billing_outbox_jobs` tables for
  Quotation, Purchase, Payment, and Dashboard runtime records.
- Moved sign-in throttling counters to the Platform
  `auth_login_attempts` table using hashed attempt keys so limits survive
  restarts and apply consistently across API processes.
- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Added forward migrations that preserve existing registry data while renaming
  retained tables to the `devkit_platform_registry_*` ownership namespace.
- Added one-time cleanup of retired DevKit project, issue-roadmap, planning,
  task, synchronization, attachment, and legacy user tables in master and
  enabled tenant databases.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Restricted DevKit to the Super Admin desk and master database. Tenant desks
  no longer expose DevKit in the breadcrumb app switcher, landing choices,
  routes, app assignments, permissions, migrations, or seeds; direct tenant
  API access now fails with a Super Admin-only response while the Super Admin
  Platform Registry remains available.
- Replaced Task Manager JSON stores with repository and service paths backed by
  the Platform database, and added persistence regression coverage that
  prevents JSON writes or the in-memory queue backend from returning.
- Classified remaining maps and browser storage as transient connection pools,
  migration guards, request de-duplication, UI selections, or non-authoritative
  client context; these are intentionally not business persistence.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.44.
- Released DevKit as a Platform Registry-only application across its API,
  frontend workspace, Platform navigation, package exports, and production
  assets.
- Removed the Overview, Projects, Issue Roadmap, Tasks, Whiteboards, GitHub,
  Design System, Sync, and Work Automation modules, routes, dependencies,
  environment settings, seeds, and empty directories.
- Updated module-boundary enforcement, repository inventory, and composed E2E
  coverage; retired DevKit endpoints are explicitly verified as unavailable.
- Changed Quotation, Sales, Purchase, Receipt, Payment, and Export Sales
  quantity, price/rate, amount, allocation, adjustment, and round-off controls
  to decimal-friendly text inputs. Editable text is preserved while typing,
  owner API routes parse finite decimals before service processing, and
  regression tests prevent native number boxes and keystroke coercion from
  returning.
- Fixed Quotation, Sales, Purchase, and Export Sales product popups so inline
  Product Category, HSN Code, Unit, and GST Tax creation reaches the correct
  Core owner contract, refreshes and selects the persisted option, and works
  during both product creation and editing. Product and address popups now show
  save/API failures in a compact top banner, mark mandatory fields, and use red
  invalid rings without per-field helper text. Refreshed and newly created
  product lookup options now share the same persisted ID, preventing duplicate
  dropdown rows while retaining Core uniqueness enforcement. Successful
  product creation or editing from a Billing document now invalidates Core's
  public Product Master query so the master list is current on navigation.
- Fixed Billing product editing for Core's persisted no-tax sentinel. Product
  popup writes now submit only Core-owned Product fields, so the sentinel's
  internal `-1` tax rate is not rejected by Billing validation, and dropdowns
  display its `-` description instead of `-1%`.
- Canonicalized newly created Core GST tax records to store only their numeric
  rate (for example `34`) while Billing product popups and Product Master
  consistently render the presentation label as `34%`. Existing default tax
  seed descriptions are normalized repeatably, and the protected no-tax
  sentinel continues to display as `-`.
- Made Work Order code mandatory in Quotation, Sales, Purchase, and Export
  Sales quick-create and edit popups. Missing names or codes now keep the popup
  open, show a compact top error banner, and highlight the invalid controls
  without adding per-field helper text. Invalid inputs retain their red border
  and focus ring while empty, then return to the normal input style as soon as
  the user enters a valid value.

## v-1.0.43

### [v 1.0.43] 2026-07-30 11:21 pm - DevKit Platform Registry Consolidation

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes.
- Preserved registry hierarchy and audit data while renaming its tables to the
  `devkit_platform_registry_*` ownership namespace.
- Added a one-time cleanup migration that removes retired DevKit project,
  attachment, planning, task, sync, and legacy user tables from master and
  enabled tenant databases.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Reduced DevKit to the Platform Registry frontend workspace and backend module.
- Removed Overview, Projects, Issue Roadmap, Tasks, Whiteboards, GitHub,
  Design System, synchronization, and work-automation UI, routes, modules,
  assets, dependencies, environment settings, and empty directories.
- Updated Platform composition, module-boundary enforcement, documentation,
  production asset copying, and composed E2E coverage for the registry-only
  contract.

### [v 1.0.43] 2026-07-30 10:59 am - Production Environment and Deployment Hardening

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes.
- Made migration checksums build-mode stable across source execution and compiled
  production containers, and expanded the migration contract suite to reject
  duplicate SQL columns and ambiguous repeatable-seed updates.
- Added forward migration steps that install database-generated 8-character
  UUID defaults on existing Platform, tenant-runtime, Core, Billing, and Mail
  tables without replacing persisted identifiers.
- Corrected duplicate company social-link and Billing settings column
  declarations and qualified the contact seed's no-op duplicate update for
  repeatable MariaDB execution.
- Kept the default company, financial year, and landing application in the
  tenant database's singleton `core_default_company_settings` record so startup
  selection survives application and infrastructure restarts.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.43.
- Made the root `.env` the mandatory deployment source for application ports,
  MariaDB, Redis, File Browser, JWT/session keys, administrator accounts, tenant
  defaults, image versions, and public runtime settings; removed deployment
  fallbacks and the secondary deploy-environment contract.
- Added interactive credential-preserving environment configuration,
  non-interactive infrastructure-secret generation, strict production
  validation, and startup connectivity smoke tests for MariaDB and Redis.
- Grouped the root `.env` and `.env.example` into readable runtime, database,
  queue, mail, tenant, authentication, user, storage, tooling, and deployment
  sections; made the configuration writer preserve those comments and blank
  lines on every update instead of flattening the environment file.
- Reduced Platform listener configuration to API port, Web port, and canonical
  Web origin; runtime code now derives bind addresses, the internal API URL,
  Vite allowed hosts, proxy targets, and local CORS aliases instead of requiring
  five duplicate host/URL environment values.
- Unified landing-application reads and writes through Default Company so
  Tenant App Connections, the tenant Landing Desk, and Default Company editing
  update the same persisted startup record.
- Updated tenant login/session startup to resolve the company, financial year,
  enabled applications, and landing application from the configured Default
  Company instead of tenant settings.
- Hardened Compose, Dockerfiles, setup, migration, cleanup, smoke-test, and
  database-user tooling to fail when required environment input is absent and
  to preserve named MariaDB, Redis, media, and application-storage volumes.
- Added root `setup.sh` and guarded `update.sh` deployment entrypoints in the
  TechMedia operator style, including read-only update checks, Compose ownership
  refusal, pre-migration MariaDB backup, application-only replacement, complete
  smoke verification, and automatic API/Web image rollback on failure.
- Made root `setup.sh` run environment configuration and deployment validation
  automatically, with a Docker Node fallback so Linux deployment hosts do not
  require a host-level Node.js or npm installation.
- Consolidated the complete installer and environment configuration workflow
  into the repository-root `setup.sh`; removed the nested
  `.container/setup.sh` entrypoint and updated cleanup and recovery guidance to
  call the root installer.
- Added an optional root setup cleanup menu with application-only,
  data-preserving runtime, and complete local-data scopes; full cleanup covers
  MariaDB, Redis, File Browser, application storage, named volumes, and the
  CODEXSUN network, while BuildKit pruning remains a separate explicit choice.
- Made deployment configuration apply the required production, container
  MariaDB, Redis queue, and single-tenant seed selections before validation so
  root setup does not depend on manual development-to-container `.env` edits.
- Split local development `.env` from private
  `.container/deploy.env`, added a shareable `deploy.env.sample`, and rewired
  Compose, setup, update, cleanup, migrations, and smoke tooling to the
  deployment file so local and container runtimes can operate in parallel.
- Added separate setup confirmations for copying compatible non-secret local
  values and reusing local credentials; deployment ports, database topology,
  container resources, and existing deployment secrets remain independently
  owned.
- Made the root setup dialogue show exact current non-secret deployment values
  instead of hashes, label existing credentials without printing them, and run
  the environment configurator directly through Node.js without npm wrapper
  noise.
- Replaced the session-expired card inside tenant, administrator, and super
  administrator login forms with one compact yellow message badge below the
  shared login card.
- Renamed the deployed application containers from
  `codexsun-platform-api`/`codexsun-platform-web` to `cxsun-api`/`cxsun-web` and
  updated the internal API hostname, cleanup workflow, and deployment
  documentation.
- Verified a production build and repeat deployment with persistent
  MariaDB/Redis/File Browser data, authenticated Super Admin, software-admin,
  tenant-admin, default-tenant-admin, and File Browser access, plus live API,
  web, media, database, tenant-module, and internal container-connectivity
  smoke checks.

## v-1.0.42

### [v 1.0.42] 2026-07-21 11:52 pm - updated dockers

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes.
- Consolidated the current fresh-install schema into module-owned Platform,
  tenant-runtime, Core, Billing, and Mail batch-1 migrations.
- Added the shared `app_migration_batches` version/checksum/status ledger,
  advisory locking, bounded batch execution, checksum validation, retry state,
  guarded rollback, and reversible legacy table-prefix planning.
- Standardized fresh tables on integer auto-increment IDs, 8-character UUIDs,
  status and audit timestamps, `created_by`, owner prefixes, and explicit
  foreign-key delete policies.
- Removed destructive baseline table/column drops and moved compatibility data
  updates out of repeatable seeders.
- Made default seeders additive so existing tenant-admin passwords, tenant
  module JSON, and edited Core lookup data are preserved.
- Added migration contract tests for schema standards, destructive-DDL
  exclusions, checksum changes, and forward/backward prefix compatibility.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.42.
- Redirected expired browser sessions from every protected Platform, Core,
  Billing, and Mail screen to the correct tenant, staff, or Super Admin login
  route, cleared cached session context, and added a session-expired login
  banner without redirecting failed login or other public requests.

## v-1.0.41

### [v 1.0.41] 2026-07-21 10:58 pm - Platform Runtime Resilience and Browser Compatibility

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (runtime transport, process supervision, deployment routing, browser compatibility, tests, and documentation only).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Fixed local login CORS by deriving exact `localhost:7020` and `127.0.0.1:7020` development origins from the canonical Platform Web configuration while retaining exact-origin production enforcement.
- Changed Platform browser API traffic to the same-origin `/api/platform` route and added matching Vite and nginx proxies so live cloud bundles never embed loopback or container-only API addresses.
- Separated development dependency installation from production Web compilation so deployed Vite bundles use production mode.
- Added API-first readiness gates and continuous API/Web health supervision to the combined root `dev` runtime while retaining `dev:api` for backend-only development and `dev:web` for frontend-only development.
- Made the separate `dev:web` startup wait for the configured Platform API health endpoint before launching Vite, preventing transient `ECONNREFUSED` proxy failures when frontend and backend commands start concurrently.
- Normalized empty and non-JSON gateway responses in the Platform browser transport so upstream failures produce actionable availability messages instead of `Unexpected end of JSON input`.
- Added the `Permissions-Policy: unload=*` compatibility response header in Vite and nginx for Chromium browser-extension listeners, including injected frames.
- Added trusted login-preflight and rejected-origin E2E coverage, and verified composed runtime startup, same-origin login routing, browser response headers, module boundaries, dependency layout, TypeScript, lint, and production builds.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.41.

## v-1.0.40

### [v 1.0.40] 2026-07-21 1:46 pm - Environment Contract Consolidation

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (runtime configuration, application wiring, deployment, and documentation changes only).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Consolidated the development and deployment environment contracts so each runtime feature has one canonical variable.
- Removed the duplicate `API_HOST`, `PLATFORM_WEB_ORIGINS`, `VITE_PLATFORM_API_URL`, `VITE_TENANT_NAME`, and `VITE_DEV_AUTO_TENANT_LOGIN` environment entries.
- Made `PLATFORM_API_URL` the single internal API endpoint consumed by the Platform server and Vite proxy; browser builds now use the fixed same-origin `/api/platform` route.
- Reused `DEFAULT_TENANT_NAME` and `DEV_AUTO_TENANT_LOGIN` for browser build configuration instead of maintaining frontend-only aliases.
- Reduced the primary runtime block to `NODE_ENV`, `PLATFORM_API_PORT`, `PLATFORM_WEB_PORT`, `PLATFORM_WEB_ORIGIN`, and `PLATFORM_API_URL`.
- Derived local CORS compatibility for equivalent `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` origins from the single configured Web origin.
- Added exact login-preflight coverage, kept unconfigured origins blocked, and routed container/browser API traffic through same-origin nginx and Vite proxies so cloud bundles never embed loopback API addresses.
- Separated development dependency installation from production Vite compilation so live bundles report production mode while retaining all build tooling.
- Added an `unload` compatibility permissions policy to Platform Vite and nginx responses so legacy browser-extension listeners, including injected frames, do not emit Chromium policy violations during the staged deprecation.
- Sequenced the consolidated development startup behind API and Web health gates, made legacy `dev:api` and `dev:web` commands start the complete Platform runtime, and stopped the stack when either owned process exits.
- Normalized empty and non-JSON gateway responses in the Platform browser transport so an unavailable API produces an actionable error instead of an `Unexpected end of JSON input` exception.
- Required published application and infrastructure ports, public URLs, and GSP endpoints to come from deployment environment input while retaining fixed private container implementation ports.
- Updated container build arguments, Compose wiring, preflight startup, smoke checks, examples, and deployment documentation for the consolidated contract.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.40.

## v-1.0.39

### [v 1.0.39] 2026-07-21 10:18 am - Unified Platform Runtime and Package Manifests

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (runtime, tooling, packaging, deployment, and documentation changes only).
- Enabled Billing and Mail by default for newly created tenants and reconciled default-tenant seeds, while retaining explicit per-tenant opt-out controls.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Consolidated application startup into the single root `npm run dev` command, which launches only the Platform API on
  port 7010 and Platform Web on port 7020.
- Converted Core, Billing, and Mail into Platform-composed API/web packages while retaining Framework and UI as shared
  infrastructure packages with explicit ownership boundaries.
- Removed standalone Core and Billing server/Vite entrypoints, obsolete ports 7030 through 7060, the domain gateway,
  product-specific process controls, and stale development environment variables.
- Reduced container, hosted nginx, systemd, CI, smoke-test, and product-stack configuration to the composed Platform API
  and Platform Web deployment.
- Consolidated shared compiler, lint, build, type, Vite, Tailwind, and operational tooling into the root `package.json`;
  workspace manifests now retain only package checks and direct runtime dependency contracts.
- Moved database operations and the sole development command to the root manifest, removed unused dependency declarations,
  transferred UI-owned fonts and editor/style dependencies to `@codexsun/ui`, and regenerated the single root lockfile.
- Added composed Platform runtime E2E coverage and updated persistence and live-mass harnesses to consume the Platform
  composition root instead of standalone product applications.
- Consolidated Platform, tenant runtime, Core, Billing, and Mail migration/seed orchestration into one deterministic
  dependency order while retaining every SQL migration and seeder inside its owning module.
- Split tenant migration from seeding, repaired root database commands that referenced removed workspace scripts, and
  made tenant setup/reinstall run all selected migrations before repeatable seeders.
- Added per-leaf Core migration ledger entries, executed every Billing module seeder, included Platform lifecycle
  policies previously skipped by master bootstrap, and expanded reinstall E2E coverage to verify Mail.
- Updated startup, deployment, app-orchestration, package-management, inventory, and UI verification documentation to
  describe the two-port composed Platform runtime.
- Validated the production container stack locally with Platform API/Web, MariaDB, Redis, Media, the default `codexsun`
  tenant, Billing, Mail, and all administrator login paths; expanded the reusable smoke test to cover these dependencies.
- Consolidated deploy environment preparation for database, super-admin, software-admin, tenant-admin, default tenant,
  and Mail fallback values, while keeping the generated credential file ignored and persistent.
- Fixed the container migration-state command after root manifest consolidation and upgraded jsPDF and Nodemailer to
  patched releases with a zero-vulnerability production dependency audit.
- Added a separate pre-start container runtime refresh command that synchronizes Node and npm from the development
  workspace, pulls and verifies the matching base image, and installs the same npm release in the API runtime image.
- Hardened PDF capture with a bounded render size and disabled Nodemailer filesystem/URL content access while retaining
  the latest compatible jsPDF and Nodemailer releases.
- Added an explicit multi-origin CORS allowlist so container Web access through both `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` can
  authenticate against the Platform API while production deployments retain an exact origin list.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.39.

## v-1.0.38

### [v 1.0.38] 2026-07-21 9:26 am - Repository Application Cleanup

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Removed the complete B2B Connect and Ecommerce application boundaries, including API/web workspaces, public pages,
  authentication and profile modules, container projects, deployment composition, routes, menus, environment values,
  package dependencies, generated output, and active documentation references.
- Removed the complete Data Bridge and Kitchen Serve application boundaries, including their migration/reconciliation
  and service-order modules, Platform desk/orchestration integration, development and preflight services, runtime ports,
  deployment stubs, workspace packages, local JSON runtime stores, generated artifacts, and active documentation.
- Removed the complete Sites application boundary and all CODEXSUN, LogicX, and Tech Media client implementations,
  media assets, Vite workspace, development/domain routes, product-stack contract, static container project, hosted
  publishing configuration, environment values, release tags, build output, and active architecture references.
- Reduced the active repository to Platform, Core, Billing, and Mail with eleven npm workspaces, one Billing product
  release contract, and one container deployment composed from Billing plus the persistent MariaDB, Redis, and Media
  infrastructure layer.
- Cleaned root scripts, module-boundary registration, app orchestration, package manifests, the root lockfile, environment
  templates, Docker helpers, hosted nginx guidance, repository inventory, deployment documentation, caches, and root
  production output so removed applications are not part of active source or generated artifacts.
- Updated the supported development baseline to Node.js 26.5.0, npm 12.0.1, and TypeScript 7.0.2 while retaining npm
  as the sole root workspace package manager and preserving a single root dependency tree and build-output directory.
- Verified a clean npm installation, module ownership boundaries, the reduced product-stack contract, TypeScript, ESLint,
  production builds, dependency layout, version alignment, shell syntax, diff integrity, and active-source/generated-output
  trace scans after the cleanup. Database-backed and live-browser E2E suites were not part of this cleanup verification.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.38.

## v-1.0.37

### [v 1.0.37] 2026-07-19 1:39 pm - Billing-First Public Product Experience

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Removed the Sites application, its three public-site clients, static assets, workspace package, development commands,
  product-stack contract, container image/Compose project, hosted publishing rules, and environment/deployment entries.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.37.
- Repositioned the Platform-owned public application site around a billing-first product story covering quotations,
  invoices, GST-ready document preparation, e-way bills, e-invoices, sales, purchases, receipts, payments, ledgers,
  receivables, reports, and digital document history.
- Rewrote Home, Billing, Features, Security, Blog, Updates, About, Contact, Privacy, and Terms with practical content for
  billing staff, accounts teams, business owners, new-employee onboarding, responsibility changes, and staff handovers.
- Removed tenant-architecture, multi-tenant, multi-company, and industry-pack marketing language from the rendered public
  experience while retaining the existing backend-driven brand, theme, login, and connected-site contract.
- Added reusable billing editorial data for invoice, compliance, accounts, monitoring, automation, handover, and digital
  documentation stories without moving application business behavior outside its owning modules.
- Added colour-coded billing and accounts cards, animated live-status indicators, rotating control rings, document-flow
  interactions, responsive hover states, and reduced-motion-safe fallbacks.
- Limited AI and maintenance messaging to supporting concerns: reviewed assistance for repetitive preparation and
  unobtrusive background processing for exports, integrations, documents, and service operations.
- Added a CODEXSUN fallback brand for an unconfigured local public portal while preserving configured organisation branding.
- Verified formatting, Platform Web lint and TypeScript, Platform module boundaries, root dependency layout, version
  alignment, production build output, all public routes, billing-language exclusions, and desktop/mobile rendering.

## v-1.0.36

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-19 - Billing-First Public Product Story

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Reworked the complete public application site around invoicing, e-way bills, e-invoices, accounts, live monitoring,
  staff controls, handovers, workflow accuracy, and digital documents.
- Removed tenant-architecture, multi-tenant, and industry-pack language from customer-facing copy while preserving the
  existing backend-driven branding and application entry contract.
- Added colour-coded billing content, animated document-flow cues, live status accents, and reduced-motion-safe
  interactions across the public pages.
- Kept maintenance and AI as supporting product concerns rather than the primary marketing story.

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-19 - Rich Tenant Product Experience

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Upgraded the tenant-aware public application site with richer product storytelling, tenant-derived workspace previews,
  progressive-growth journeys, operational outcomes, editorial blog presentation, release guidance, support preparation,
  page-owned FAQs, and expanded privacy and terms content.
- Added and wired a dedicated `/security` page covering domain-based tenant resolution, authenticated access, role and
  permission scope, tenant database routing, audit expectations, and evidence-based assurance without unsupported
  certification claims.
- Expanded the shared tenant-site visual system with responsive product-preview, security-model, capability, growth,
  editorial, FAQ, assurance, and legal content blocks while preserving the tenant portal module as the only public data
  contract.

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-19 - Tenant-Aware Public Application Pages

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Refactored the Platform tenant home into an extensible public application-site composition with tenant-aware context,
  shared navigation and footer blocks, landing sections, and a reusable page template under `src/public/tenant-site`.
- Added and wired public Workspace, Features, Blog, Updates, About, Contact, Privacy, and Terms pages. Every page resolves
  the current tenant's domain branding, theme, content, login route, and connected public-site URL through the existing
  tenant portal read contract.
- Expanded the application footer into standard Workspace, Company, and Application navigation groups without coupling
  the app-owned public pages to the separate Sites application.

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-19 - Platform Tenant Home Public Ownership

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Moved the tenant-facing Platform home page and its page stylesheet from the tenant portal module into
  `apps/platform/web/src/public`, while keeping tenant portal data access and types owned by the module.
- Updated the `/` route to lazy-load the new `public/tenant-home.tsx` entry directly.

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-19 - Platform Dashboard Home Correction

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Corrected the shared dashboard Home action to return to the Platform root on the current app origin. Local access
  from `http://127.0.0.1:7020` now returns to `http://127.0.0.1:7020/` instead of the public Sites hostname.

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-19 - Dashboard Header Actions

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Removed the unused desk-tools suitcase control and the hardcoded notification count from the shared dashboard top
  bar.
- Dashboard Home now resolves the tenant-configured public site with the deployed Codexsun public-site origin as its
  fallback, and top-bar Logout now closes the active desk session before returning to its login page.

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-18 10:52 pm - Warm-Cache Tenant Reinstall Repair

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No new schema definition. Existing tenant databases can be repaired through the same managed
  setup/reinstall path.
- Core and Billing maintenance lifecycles now invalidate only the target tenant's in-process bootstrap state before
  rerunning their owned migrations and repeatable seeds. This restores the complete selected-app schema even when the
  database was dropped or recreated while the Platform API remained running.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Tenant app composition now calls the forced Core and Billing tenant migration contracts for every managed setup,
  reinstall, safe migration, tenant save/update, and database CLI migration.
- Expanded the bootstrap E2E to warm both app caches, drop the tenant database, run Re-install in the same process,
  and verify the complete 20-migration Billing schema is rebuilt with no running maintenance rows.

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-18 10:32 pm - Selected-App Tenant Provisioning Lifecycle

#### Database Changes

- Tenant creation, update, setup, reinstall, safe migration, and database CLI migration now apply the selected app
  lifecycle in dependency order: Platform tenant foundation first, Core prerequisites before Billing, Billing-owned
  migrations and repeatable seeds next, and Mail only when Mail is enabled.
- Billing-selected tenants now receive the complete 20-row migration ledger and all Core/Billing tables during the
  initial tenant save instead of stopping at the Platform/Mail foundation.
- Database maintenance operations now complete or fail their original run row. The Platform migration removes the
  historical duplicate `running` row when its exact matching terminal row was written at the same timestamp.
- Existing tenant data is preserved. Re-running the tenant migration is required to install missing selected-app
  tables in already-created tenant databases.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added public Core and Billing tenant database lifecycle exports and a Platform composition sequence that consumes
  module-owned migrations without moving schema behavior out of the owning applications.
- Tenant database migration plans now include the complete selected-app plan, so pending migration status reflects
  Core, Billing, and Mail requirements rather than Platform foundation migrations alone.
- Expanded the bootstrap E2E to create a Billing-selected tenant through the same Tenant Service save path, verify all
  required tables and 20 migrations, confirm Mail remains uninstalled when not selected, and validate both run
  finalization and legacy-run reconciliation across restart.

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-18 10:09 pm - Tenant App Selection Cards

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No. Tenant app activation continues to use the existing registry and tenant connection contracts.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Reworked Tenant app-selection cards in both show and upsert flows with the established three-column tile layout,
  app-specific icons, Enabled/Disabled status pills, descriptions, and top-aligned activation switches.
- Kept the Application connection visibly enabled and locked, preserved landing-app selection and save behavior, and
  added an iconless option to the shared workspace status badge for compact card statuses.

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-18 9:59 pm - Established Login Experience Restored

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No. Authentication persistence and API contracts are unchanged.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Restored the established shared `AuthLayout` experience for `/login`, `/sa/login`, and the shared admin login route,
  including the CODEXSUN brand mark, desk-specific badge, design-system fields, submit button, loading state, and error
  presentation.
- Removed the replacement public-site login markup, tenant-portal branding request, cross-login links, and its obsolete
  page-specific stylesheet without changing login submission, development auto-login, or post-login destinations.

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-18 9:40 pm - Same-Origin Core and Billing API Routing

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No. This fix changes browser-to-API routing only.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Replaced browser-facing loopback Core and Billing API URLs with same-origin `/api/core` and `/api/billing` gateway
  paths so Platform works from `127.0.0.1:7020`, `app.codexsun.test`, tenant app domains, and `app.codexsun.com` without
  CORS exceptions.
- Added Core and Billing proxying to their local Vite entry points, the Platform Vite server, and the hosted nginx
  Platform server while preserving existing tenant authorization and database-context headers.
- Added hosted Core and Billing API systemd units and deployment commands required by the production API proxies.
- Documented same-origin Platform/Core/Billing API routing and hosted verification commands.

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-18 2:40 pm - Marketing and Tenant App Portal Separation

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No schema or seed migration. Tenant-specific portal content uses the existing tenant-owned
  `payload_settings` JSON column under the validated `appPortal` key.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Removed the Platform web dependency, TypeScript alias, lazy imports, and root marketing routes for
  `@codexsun/sites-web`; Platform and Sites now build and run without importing each other.
- Kept the existing CODEXSUN marketing site under Sites and routed its application, status, and login links through
  `VITE_PLATFORM_WEB_ORIGIN`, targeting `app.codexsun.com` in production.
- Added a responsive Platform app portal at `/` with shared tenant-aware navigation, animated slider, feature cards,
  update/blog cards, public-site return link, workspace login actions, and footer.
- Added the validated public `/public/app-portal` API projection with domain resolution, canonical default-tenant
  fallback, safe URL handling, bounded content, and no exposure of raw tenant settings or database credentials.
- Added an App portal tab to tenant upsert for per-tenant brand, theme, hero, slider, features, updates, footer, and
  optional marketing-site content while preserving unrelated tenant payload settings.
- Added `app.codexsun.test` to the local domain gateway, removed the old `aaran.test` root-to-login redirect, and
  documented the local-to-live domain mapping for `app.codexsun.com` and `app.tenant.com`.
- Updated hosted environment and architecture guidance with `PLATFORM_PUBLIC_SITE_ORIGIN`, strict Sites/Platform
  ownership, tenant-domain registration, and production publishing behavior.
- Verified Platform API/web and Sites lint, TypeScript, module boundaries, all production builds, desktop/mobile app
  portal rendering, tenant-safe API fallback, and preservation of the CODEXSUN marketing homepage.

### [v 1.0.36] 2026-07-18 10:23 am - Client Sites and Domain Routing

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual). No tenant, tenant-domain, migration, seed, or tenant-database record was created or changed in this release.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added the dedicated `apps/sites/web` workspace with independently owned CODEXSUN, LogicX, and Tech Media public-site clients and separate production artifacts under `dist/apps/sites/web/{client}`.
- Moved the CODEXSUN creator site out of Platform public source while retaining temporary Platform composition through the Sites public export for local root-route compatibility.
- Adapted the Interfrozt frontend into the CODEXSUN identity without redesigning its visual foundation, including refined navigation, animated hero messaging, product sections, enterprise presentation, outcome content, compact page rails, and responsive public layouts.
- Reworked Selected Work into a compact project grid with independently presented CODEXSUN Platform, Billing Suite, and Zero case material, while removing the obsolete Project Overview presentation.
- Added independently branded LogicX and Tech Media sites that reuse only visual infrastructure and retain concrete client-owned content, routes, metadata, and themes.
- Added temporary root development commands for CODEXSUN, LogicX, and Tech Media on ports `7130`, `7131`, and `7132`, plus a combined `npm run dev:sites:all` launcher.
- Added the local port-80 development domain gateway for `codexsun.test`, `logicx.test`, `techmedia.test`, and the `aaran.test` Platform tenant workspace, including Vite WebSocket forwarding and preserved tenant host headers.
- Changed Platform development API access to the same-origin `/api/platform` path so tenant-domain resolution receives the browser hostname instead of the loopback API hostname.
- Expanded the hosted nginx baseline to publish `codexsun.com`, `logicx.in`, and `techmedia.in` from independent Sites artifacts while serving `app.codexsun.com` and registered tenant domains from Platform.
- Updated deployment, project inventory, environment, build, DNS, certificate, and hosted publishing documentation for the new Sites and domain topology.
- Verified formatting, Platform and Sites lint and TypeScript, module boundaries, dependency layout, local hostname routing, same-origin Platform API health, and Platform plus all three Sites production builds.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.36.

## v-1.0.35

### [v 1.0.35] 2026-07-17 8:54 am - Billing and Business Services Planning

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No. This release changes product planning, release history, and lockstep package versions only; tenant and Platform schemas remain unchanged.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added the dated Billing, Accounting, Compliance, and Business Services plan under `assist/execution/planning.md`.
- Recorded the live Billing and Core capability inventory, current readiness limitations, and the prioritized GST, bookkeeping, audit, receivable/payable, purchase-automation, and commercial-document roadmap.
- Defined module ownership boundaries for Billing documents, Accounting books, Compliance workflows, reporting read models, and asynchronous integrations so future work does not become a centralized business engine.
- Added adjacent client-service plans for collections, virtual CFO, loan readiness, payroll, TDS, inventory control, CRM, industry packs, digital commerce, document automation, migration, and managed back-office operations.
- Added commercial packages, launch sequencing, client-acquisition offers, positioning messages, compliance wording, delivery gates, and measurable success criteria.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.35.

## v-1.0.34

### [v 1.0.34] 2026-07-15 11:13 pm - Billing Address and Date Picker Reliability

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes. Added tenant-owned `mail_settings`, `mail_messages`, `mail_attachments`, and `mail_events` tables with repeatable migrations and permission seeding.
- Mail credentials are encrypted before tenant persistence; message, attachment, provider, and delivery state remain inside each tenant database.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added the standalone Mail API/web workspaces with Inbox, Outbox, Drafts, Scheduled, Sent, Failed, Trash, rich compose, attachments, tenant SMTP plus IMAP/POP3 settings, environment fallback, and responsive three-column navigation.
- Added tenant-aware queue processing for SMTP delivery and inbound synchronization with idempotency, retry/backoff, delivery events, failed-message visibility, and environment credential fallback.
- Wired Sales, Quotation, Purchase, and Export Sales email tools to capture their rendered document as a PDF, prepare a branded rich message, and enqueue delivery through Mail's public contract.
- Corrected Quotation address and compliance presentation by exposing the document date in the list and resolving customer GSTIN plus Billing/Shipping State names and codes for show and print output.
- Added a narrow Core Contact-address create/update contract that preserves sibling addresses and validates the persisted Country, State, District, City, Pincode, and Address Type hierarchy.
- Wired Quotation, Sales, Purchase, and Export Sales address editors through their module-owned Billing lookup routes so an address popup can append a missing address or update the selected address without replacing the Contact or collapsing formatted location lines into Address line 2.
- Added visible Country selection to the Billing and Shipping address editors, retained India as the create default, cleared dependent location values when Country changes, and hydrated edit forms from structured address records.
- Confirmed Receipt and Payment continue to use their structured Contact popup with visible Country and India default behavior.
- Refined the shared workspace date picker with compact Month and Year autocomplete controls, equal fixed-height scrollable lists, narrow aligned dropdowns, ultra-thin scrollbars, single-line options, typed filtering, and full-list display with the current value highlighted whenever either control receives focus.
- Added opt-in presentation controls to `WorkspaceLookup` for compact option rows, dropdown width/class overrides, icon visibility, clearing behavior, and full-list-on-focus behavior without changing existing lookup defaults.
- Verified Core API, Billing API, Billing web, and UI package formatting, lint, TypeScript, production builds, module boundaries, dependency layout, diff integrity, and database-backed Quotation persistence/conversion coverage during the implementation batch.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.34.

## v-1.0.33

### [v 1.0.33] 2026-07-14 11:25 pm - Billing Concurrency and Tenant Runtime Hardening

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (automatic repeatable tenant authorization seeds; no schema migration).
- Added module-owned Core and Billing permission seeds that upsert the new view, create, update, delete, lifecycle, and compliance permissions and grant them to each tenant administrator role during lazy tenant bootstrap.
- Existing tenant databases receive the authorization repair automatically on their first Core or Billing bootstrap after deployment; no table alteration or manual data backfill is required.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Consolidated production deployment into four independent MariaDB, Redis, Media, and Billing stacks; Billing now packages Framework-backed Platform, Core, and Billing services.
- Live-tested the complete local Docker deployment, including production migration gating, persistent Billing storage ownership, the Platform public-storage compatibility link, authenticated Redis and Media access, and health checks for all six Billing services.
- Split complete-stack lifecycle into non-destructive `setup.sh` install/reinstall commands and a Billing-only `deploy.sh`; Billing reinstall now replaces only application containers/images, applies forward migrations, reports the migration ledger, and cannot manage infrastructure or remove database volumes.
- Added repeatable default-tenant deployment inputs, persistent tenant-storage mapping, and setup-time MariaDB grant reconciliation; live install, full reinstall, and Billing-only reinstall preserve the `1:1:19:1` master/tenant migration-and-user signature while all endpoints remain healthy.
- Finalized the deployment lifecycle commands: `.container/setup.sh` installs the complete stack, `.container/setup.sh --reinstall` rebuilds every stack without deleting named volumes, and `.container/deploy.sh billing --reinstall` replaces only Billing backend/frontend containers and images while leaving MariaDB, Redis, and Media untouched.
- Added pre-teardown configuration validation, infrastructure health checks, forward-only migration execution, and applied migration-ledger reporting. Database fresh/reset flags remain prohibited and neither reinstall path contains database-drop or volume-removal operations.
- Added an ignored deployment input workflow that preserves explicit operator values, imports matching secrets from repository `.env`, generates missing random credentials, and synchronizes the Media administrator with the resolved Super Admin password.
- Replaced per-app duplicate images with one shared Billing API image, one shared Billing web image, and one explicit Platform/Core/Billing migration image, leaving room for Accounts modules to extend the same release boundary.
- Added concurrent Sales invoice reservation recovery: conflicting create or draft-update requests save with the next configured number and return a user-visible warning, while the persisted next-number setting advances atomically.
- Added retry-safe document line numbering across Quotation, Sales, Purchase, Export Sales, Payment, and Receipt to prevent simultaneous same-tenant inserts from failing on line-number collisions.
- Serialized Payment and Receipt allocation validation with row locks and deterministic lock ordering so two users cannot allocate the same outstanding Purchase or Sale balance.
- Enforced tenant role permissions for Core and Billing read, mutation, lifecycle, and compliance requests instead of relying on tenant-token membership alone.
- Limited Core and Billing tenant connection pools, evicted pools after ten minutes of inactivity, and replaced startup-wide tenant migration and seeding with lazy per-tenant bootstrap while retaining the explicit database-stack migration command.
- Added module-owned SQL pagination, server-side search and status filtering, bounded hydration, and accurate totals for Quotation, Sales, Purchase, Export Sales, Payment, and Receipt workspaces; page size is capped at 200 records.
- Extended persistence and five-tenant mass E2E coverage for concurrent Sales numbering, bounded document pages, tenant isolation, authorization seed upgrades, fresh bootstrap, and restart bootstrap behavior.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.33.

## v-1.0.32

### [v 1.0.32] 2026-07-14 09:32 pm - Tamil Nadu State Priority

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (automatic repeatable Core seed ordering; no schema migration).
- Kept the fallback `-` State first, made Tamil Nadu the second State with sort order one, and shifted the earlier seeded States down to preserve unique deterministic ordering.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Extended persistence E2E coverage to require `-` first and Tamil Nadu second in the database-backed State lookup order.
- Verified the same ordering in the live tenant database after Core startup reseeding.

### [v 1.0.32] 2026-07-14 09:29 pm - India-First Country Default

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (automatic repeatable Core seed cleanup; no schema migration).
- Removed the `-`/`UNKNOWN` Country seed and made India the first Country seed with sort order zero.
- Reparented the fallback and legacy user-created States plus existing Contact address Country references from the removed Country to India before deleting the obsolete Country row.
- Kept the fallback State, District, City, and Pincode chain valid under India for minimal Contact defaults.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Made new Contact popups resolve their initial India label to the persisted India Country ID in Quotation, Sales, Purchase, Export Sales, Payment, and Receipt while retaining full Country override support.
- Extended tenant persistence E2E coverage for fresh India-first seeds, absence of the hyphen Country, fallback hierarchy validity, legacy State and Contact-address cleanup, and repeatable reseeding.
- Verified the live Sales new-Contact popup starts with India and can be overridden with United States.

### [v 1.0.32] 2026-07-14 09:16 pm - Contact Country Selection

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added a visible, database-backed Country lookup before State in the Quotation, Sales, Purchase, Export Sales, Payment, and Receipt contact popups.
- Made a Country change clear the dependent State, District, City, and Pincode values so each lower lookup is filtered through one consistent persisted hierarchy.
- Verified in the live Sales popup that changing the default `-` Country to India exposes and selects Tamil Nadu without changing persisted contact data during the test.

### [v 1.0.32] 2026-07-14 09:07 pm - Referenced Contact Address Persistence

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Changed Contact address persistence to update retained addresses in place, preserving IDs already referenced by Quotation, Sales, Purchase, and Export Sales records instead of deleting and recreating them during a Contact edit.
- Added a clear conflict response when an address that is still referenced by a Billing record is intentionally removed.
- Added a tenant-database persistence regression that edits a Contact after its address is referenced by a Quotation and verifies that the address ID remains stable.
- Verified the live Sales contact popup through Chrome, the Core and Billing production builds, module boundaries, dependency layout, and the complete tenant-isolated Billing persistence E2E.

### [v 1.0.32] 2026-07-14 08:51 pm - Calm Workspace Data Loading

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Replaced animated workspace table and lookup skeletons with plain loading states so initial data requests no longer shimmer or fade the surrounding interface.
- Kept the last settled table rows visible while Company, Contact, Product, and Work Order searches request their next server-filtered result, preventing table collapse and flicker during typing.
- Applied the plain table-loading state across Core, Platform, and Billing workspaces through the shared workspace table primitive and the remaining module-owned custom tables.

### [v 1.0.32] 2026-07-14 06:37 pm - Company Billing Compliance Bootstrap

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (automatic tenant migration).
- Added company-scoped Billing settings keyed by Company inside each tenant database, with a one-time compatibility fallback that copies the existing tenant-wide Billing setting into a Company's first settings row.
- Added Purchase-owned E-way and E-invoice JSON columns so supplier compliance references persist with each Purchase.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added `None`, `E-way only`, and `E-invoice + E-way` GST API modes and synchronized the Billing switches so E-invoice cannot be enabled without E-way.
- Wired the saved Company mode to show or omit E-way and E-invoice tabs in Sales, Purchase, and Export Sales, and enforced the same capability checks on Sales and Export Sales generation endpoints.
- Added a tenant startup gate that confirms the authenticated session, loads the enabled tenant apps, resolves the default Company and Financial Year, publishes that context, and preloads Company Billing settings before the first application workspace paint.
- Keyed Billing settings queries and mutations by Company so Company changes cannot reuse another Company's cached feature configuration.
- Verified the Billing migration stack, company setting mode round-trips, module boundaries, dependency direction, lint, typecheck, production builds, and tenant-isolated Billing persistence E2E.

### [v 1.0.32] 2026-07-14 11:47 am - Production Docker Setup Notes

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added `assist/execution/setup.md` as the production Docker setup helper, documenting the active `.container/` deployment bundle, image build inputs, runtime services, environment requirements, upgrade path, clean reinstall flow, storage, admin tooling, reverse proxy notes, and pre-production checks.
- Recorded the installed Docker image base and runtime packages used by the production build: Node.js 22 Bookworm slim with `ca-certificates`, `curl`, `git`, `mariadb-client`, `nano`, `redis-tools`, and `sudo`.
- Replaced the shared runtime image with independently versioned Platform, Core, and Billing API/Web images plus a dedicated migration runner.
- Split MariaDB, Redis, Pictures, Files, and every application stack into individually deployable Compose projects joined through the external `codexsun-network`.
- Added explicit persistent volumes for database data/backups, Redis, each app stack, picture content/metadata, and file content/metadata; reinstall now preserves all data unless a targeted wipe flag is explicitly enabled.
- Added the Pictures/Files media setup workflow that initializes both File Browser databases and keeps their admin passwords synchronized with `SUPER_ADMIN_PASSWORD` from the repository `.env` without printing the credential.
- Tightened destructive media setup so `--wipe-media` is rejected without `--reinstall`, attached containers are reported before a wipe, and every requested Docker volume removal is verified instead of silently ignoring failures.
- Pinned all upstream Docker bases and aligned CODEXSUN image tags with workspace version `1.0.32`, with no production `latest` tags.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.32.

## v-1.0.31

### [v 1.0.31] 2026-07-14 11:08 am - Minimal Billing Draft and Default Reference Fixes

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Updated the Product seed so the protected `-` product resolves its Product Type, Product Category, HSN Code, Unit, and GST Tax foreign IDs from the existing `-` records, falling back to the first active persisted record without creating anonymous masters.
- Updated the Contact seed to resolve the demo contact's persisted Contact Type and Contact Group and to backfill one default `-` address for every active contact that has no address, using the connected seeded Country -> State -> District -> City -> Pincode hierarchy.
- Existing tenant databases require the normal repeatable Core seed pass to receive the Product relationship repair and missing-address backfill; no new table or schema migration is required.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Fixed Quotation, Sales, Purchase, and Export Sales quick-product requests so persisted Product Category, HSN Code, Unit, and GST Tax IDs are submitted as numeric foreign IDs instead of invalid strings.
- Expanded the Core Product response with its resolved type, category, HSN, unit, and GST tax relationship values and made minimal product creation reuse the existing fallback masters.
- Added default-address enrichment to minimal Contact creation so inline contacts created without address details still return a persisted address owned by that contact.
- Aligned the Core Contact Legal Name interaction with the Billing contact popup: leaving Name derives an uppercase Legal Name until it is manually edited, and the magic action restores and refreshes that derived value on demand.
- Allowed contact-only draft creation for Quotation, Sales, Purchase, and Export Sales and zero-value draft creation for Receipt and Payment while preserving line-item requirements for confirmation and positive-total requirements for posting.
- Added fallback Ledger and Work Order resolution for minimal Billing drafts and fallback cash/bank Ledger resolution for Receipt and Payment without creating placeholder business records.
- Extended the tenant-isolated persistence E2E to cover minimal Product and Contact creation, all six minimal Billing draft flows, default foreign-reference resolution, cleanup, and rejection of empty confirmation/posting actions.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.31.

## v-1.0.30

### [v 1.0.30] 2026-07-13 11:22 pm - Fresh Database Startup Verification

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Verified migration preflight against the freshly reinstalled `cxsun_master_db` and its registered `codexsun_db` tenant target with no missing or invalid database mapping.
- Ran the complete Platform -> Core -> Billing migration stack successfully and confirmed one applied master migration plus all 19 tenant migration markers, including the five tenant access-control owners and the seven Billing foundations.
- Ran the live seed stack twice without duplicate records or failures, confirming repeatable app-registry, default tenant, domain, subscription, tenant-module, Core, and Billing seed behavior.
- Verified the disposable fresh-start and restart path produces identical persisted state: three platform apps, two plans, one tenant/domain/subscription, two tenant module settings, one `codexsun` company, one current financial year, one default-company setting, one demo supplier, one Billing setting, and all seven Billing root tables.
- Confirmed the default-company seed resolves the first `codexsun` company and current financial year through persisted database identities after a clean installation.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added independently owned tenant User, Role, Permission, User Role, and Role Permission backend/frontend modules with tenant-bound authorization, migrations, seeders, lifecycle APIs, application-desk pages, and Access Control sidebar composition.
- Added mutation confirmations, success/error notifications, API-aware automatic list return, protected-record handling, and password masking across the tenant access workspaces.
- Split application routes and tenant business workspaces into lazy production chunks; the tenant desk entry chunk decreased from 801.95 kB (139.64 kB gzip) to 37.33 kB (8.80 kB gzip).
- Verified the fresh database startup with `db:migrations:preflight`, `db:migrations:run`, two `db:seed` passes, migration-ledger inspection, and the restart-safe Platform/Core/Billing bootstrap E2E.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.30.

## v-1.0.29

### [v 1.0.29] 2026-07-13 4:48 pm - working on sales

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (auto-check).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.29.

## v-1.0.28

### [v 1.0.28] 2026-07-13 9:52 am - Common List Serial Columns

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Consolidated the fresh Contact migration around the Contact master and its five owned child tables: emails, phones, addresses, bank accounts, and social links.
- Added concrete foreign keys for Contact type/group, address type, location hierarchy, and bank-name references; existing databases require the normal fresh migration path to receive the consolidated schema exactly.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Standardized all 29 Core Common frontend lists so the module-owned `sortOrder` field appears first as a centered `#` serial column with a fixed 64 px width and tabular numeric alignment.
- Preserved strict leaf ownership by keeping the serial-column definition inside each Common list rather than introducing shared or centralized business-column configuration.
- Refactored Core Master Contact into a complete module-owned backend and frontend implementation with exact migration, repository, service, routes, seed, types, list, form, hooks, services, workspace, and index responsibilities.
- Added the animated `Details`, `Tax Details`, `Communication`, `Addresses`, `Finance`, and `More` Contact form tabs with repeatable emails, phones, addresses, bank accounts, and social links.
- Wired Contact Type, Contact Group, Address Type, Bank Name, Country, State, District, City, and Pincode as searchable foreign-reference lookups with in-context creation and dependent location filtering.
- Replaced Contact child JSON read behavior with transactional persistence and hydration through the five Contact-owned child tables, including parent-reference and location-hierarchy validation.
- Verified Contact create-and-read persistence against a disposable freshly migrated tenant database, including one persisted row in every Contact child table.
- Fixed Contact address persistence so a selected country or postal code is retained even when the optional Address line 1 is empty; changing country now persists the new country while clearing stale State, District, City, and Postal Code references in sequence.
- Replaced the India-only six-digit Pincode validation with an international 2-20 character postal-code contract supporting letters, numbers, spaces, and hyphens in both the Common Pincode owner and Contact lookup creation popup.
- Moved Contact next-code generation to the Contact backend using all persisted codes, recognizing both `C-0000` and legacy `C_0001` sequences while returning the canonical next `C-####` value independently of frontend search filters.
- Aligned the Contact postal-code creation popup with the Common Country upsert tone using a compact dialog width, padded header and fields, descriptive copy, footer divider, and consistent primary/cancel action spacing.
- Replaced Product's raw Product Type, Product Category, HSN Code, Unit, and GST Tax ID inputs with Product-owned autocomplete lookups, fixed Common relationship endpoints, create-and-select flows, active-reference validation, and persisted numeric foreign IDs.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.28.

## v-1.0.27

### [v 1.0.27] 2026-07-13 8:35 am - rework on core

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (auto-check).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.27.

## v-1.0.26

### [v 1.0.26] 2026-07-13 1:31 am - Root npm Workspace and Repository Cleanup

#### Database Changes

- Database update: No (manual).

#### App Codebase Changes

- Standardized the monorepo on npm workspaces with one root `node_modules`, one root `package-lock.json`, and no pnpm or Yarn lockfiles, stores, or workspace-local dependency trees.
- Standardized generated build output on the root `dist` tree and removed nested `node_modules`, `dist`, and `dist-types` artifacts and local output configuration.
- Added mandatory Assist governance and agent rules requiring npm commands to run from the repository root and requiring `npm run dependencies:check` plus nested-artifact scanning after dependency, workspace, package, or build changes.
- Removed generated Codex runtime logs, audit output, Turbo and IDE caches, automated test/spec/E2E sources, Playwright configuration, test-runner scripts and dependencies, and the Framework test-only export.
- Updated the module-boundary checker so production module ownership validation no longer requires removed test/spec role files.
- Verified the cleaned repository with npm dependency-tree validation, root dependency-layout validation, Prettier, ESLint, and TypeScript.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.26.

## v-1.0.25

### [v 1.0.25] 2026-07-12 10:17 pm - Common Module Boundary and Location Hierarchy

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Rebuilt the Core location foundation migrations as independent Country, State, District, City, and Pincode tables with ordered foreign keys and relationship-safe delete restrictions.
- Added scoped uniqueness for State per Country, District per State, City per District, and Pincode per City.
- Moved Country, Indian State and territory, Tamil Nadu District and City, and supported Pincode seed records into their owning modules with deterministic, idempotent upserts.
- Preserved the ordered Country -> State -> District -> City -> Pincode migration and seed sequence.
- Removed redundant `tenant_id` columns and tenant-scoped indexes from all 24 non-location Core Common master migrations; the selected tenant database is now the sole data-isolation boundary.
- Changed Common master uniqueness from `(tenant_id, primary field)` to database-local primary-field uniqueness and removed tenant prefixes from generated record IDs.
- Existing development databases created from the earlier Common schema require the fresh migration workflow to physically rebuild the tables without legacy `tenant_id` columns.
- Fixed invalid trailing commas after the final unique key in all 24 non-location Common table migrations and quoted the Month `from_date` and `to_date` identifiers for MariaDB compatibility.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Refactored all 29 Core Common leaf modules to the reduced nine-file backend contract: migration, module, repository, routes, seed, service, test, types, and index.
- Replaced all 24 generic Common master wrappers with module-owned migrations, typed records and payloads, direct SQL repositories, validation services, Fastify routes, lifecycle behavior, seeds, and contract tests.
- Removed the Common master definition registry and the shared migration, repository, route, seed, service, context, and type factories; no Common leaf module extends, aliases, or delegates its backend behavior to a generic foundation.
- Removed separate definition, event, sync, and worker placeholder files while preserving each module's fields, protected placeholder rows, seed values, routes, lifecycle behavior, and table ownership.
- Removed Common-level `x-tenant-id` parsing, logical global/tenant row filtering, tenant parameters, and `tenantId` response fields; Common requests now rely exclusively on the fail-closed `x-tenant-db` database context.
- Replaced the former shared location backend with independently owned Country, State, District, City, and Pincode repositories, services, routes, contracts, migrations, seeds, and tests.
- Added normalized Country, State, District, and City relationship joins and parent validation throughout the location hierarchy.
- Added separate Pincode individual and relation endpoints; relation reads return the complete City, District, State, and Country hierarchy.
- Removed obsolete shared location helpers, shared seed data, and the stale legacy location database test that targeted the deleted global/tenant location contract.
- Formatted the complete Core Common backend and verified it with Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript, and Core API tests.
- Rebuilt all 29 Core Common frontend leaf modules as independently owned nine-file bundles: workspace, list, form, services, hooks, schema, types, spec, and index.
- Standardized Contact, Product, Workorder, Other, and Location masters on the Contact Types interaction tone with searchable paginated lists, popup upsert forms, active-state controls, edit, suspend/restore, and force-delete row actions.
- Wired every frontend leaf directly to its owning Core API route through the fail-closed `x-tenant-db` context and removed frontend `tenantId` and `x-tenant-id` handling.
- Consolidated module definitions into each leaf's owned types file and removed the unused shared Location frontend runtime; Common leaf modules no longer borrow or wrap the legacy Common Master or Location implementations.
- Verified the complete Core Common frontend with Prettier, ESLint, TypeScript, 30 passing module specs, a production build, and browser-level Country list and popup-upsert checks.
- Verified the corrected Common migrations through a real configured-database Core API bootstrap through `app.ready` and `server.listen`.
- Added a disposable MariaDB Common E2E regression covering create, restart persistence, read, update, suspend, restore, force delete, response request metadata, and the complete Pincode-to-City-to-District-to-State-to-Country relation read.
- Standardized every Core-owned table primary key on `id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY`, including all Common, Location, Master, Organisation Company, and Master child tables.
- Removed persisted and API-facing UUID columns from the complete Core schema and converted Core foreign-key and lookup ID columns to integers.
- Updated Core API repositories, seeds, services, events, sync contracts, Core Web modules, and Platform tenant-desk consumers for numeric record IDs while retaining string conversion only at URL, form-control, and local-storage boundaries.
- Extended disposable MariaDB E2E coverage to assert that every Core table has an integer auto-increment ID, no Core table contains a UUID column, Master child rows receive numeric IDs, relations remain valid, and tenant isolation still passes.
- This is a destructive development-schema change: databases created with string IDs or UUID columns must use the documented fresh migration workflow; existing IDs are not automatically remapped.
- Replaced every Core `is_active TINYINT(1)` persistence column with `status VARCHAR(24) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'active'`, including 24 non-location Common masters and Master social-link child tables.
- Removed the duplicate Master/Company `is_active` column, standardized its existing status column from `VARCHAR(32)` to `VARCHAR(24)`, and changed its tenant-state index to use status.
- Preserved the existing frontend `isActive` interaction contract by translating it to `active`/`inactive` status values in Core repositories; Master suspension continues to persist the explicit `suspend` status.
- Extended MariaDB schema E2E assertions to reject any remaining Core `is_active` column and any status column that is not `VARCHAR(24)` with the `active` default.
- Renamed the Month persistence and application contract from `from_date`/`to_date` and `fromDate`/`toDate` to `start_date`/`end_date` and `startDate`/`endDate`, including seeds, validation, repositories, frontend fields, and labels.
- Removed the unused top-level Core Common sync policy and worker placeholder files after confirming they had no executable imports or exports.
- Corrected the generic Master child-table migration so only Companies and Contacts own address, bank-account, email, phone, and social-link tables.
- Removed obsolete `products_*` and `work_orders_*` contact-detail child tables, stopped child synchronization for Product and Work Order records, and normalized any supplied contact-detail payloads to empty collections.
- Added MariaDB schema assertions requiring all ten Company/Contact child tables while rejecting every Product/Work Order contact-detail child table.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.25.

- Added App Operations maintenance pages with service availability, port response time, managed uptime, terminal PID, and per-service health metrics.
- Added guarded Open & start, Stop, Update, and Refresh controls; app starts and updates open in new visible terminals while stop is limited to process trees recorded by the orchestrator.
- Added independent Start, Stop, and Restart controls for every API/Web service with service-specific PID and uptime ownership.
- Enlarged repository app and metric cards with mild theme-token gradients, stronger icon treatment, and improved hover elevation.

- Cloned the quotation list, upsert, show, print preview, and print route into independent Sales-owned UI code.
- Added Sales item entry with product autocomplete, inline lookup creation, tax-aware CGST + SGST or IGST columns, totals, and round-off controls.
- Added Sales contact and address autocomplete flows with editable billing and shipping address dialogs.
- Added Sales comments, activity timeline, entry tools, print copies, navigation, status actions, and save toasts.
- Removed the older Sales form/list implementation from the active module exports so the cloned Sales workflow is the only owned frontend path.
- Bumped the workspace version to 1.0.15.

## v-1.0.14

### [v 1.0.14] 2026-07-10 10:02 pm - Quotation save, submit, revoke, and edit controls

## v-1.0.13

### [v 1.0.13] 2026-07-10 3:41 pm - Quotation Contact Quick Upsert

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- No database schema changes. The quotation lookup proxy creates and updates existing Core contact records.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added a contact-only quick upsert dialog to the Quotation customer lookup with name, legal name, phone, email, and address lines.
- A missing contact search now offers New contact; saving silently refreshes the lookup and selects the created contact.
- Selected contacts show an arrow edit control in place of the lookup chevron; saving refreshes and retains the edited contact selection.
- Added Billing API proxy routes for Quotation contact create/update so browser traffic remains within the Billing module boundary.
- Split quick contact upsert into Details and Address tabs, added GSTIN and Address Type, and made State, District, City, and Pincode dependent lookup/create controls with India as the hidden default country.
- Widened the contact dialog, changed the fast-entry fields to a single-column flow, removed Email from the form, and made Address Type a create-capable autocomplete.
- Added Quotation-owned create/edit lookup popups for Products and Work Orders, inline Colour and Size creation, and an Items tab that contains both quotation lines and totals without the former tab-area divider.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.13.

## v-1.0.12

### [v 1.0.12] 2026-07-10 3:27 pm - Quotation Module Consolidation

#### App Codebase Changes

- Removed the duplicate Entries quotation routes, conversion endpoint, renderer, types, and its obsolete database test.
- Made `billing/quotation` the single quotation workflow, including conversion to a Sales invoice and storing the generated invoice number on the quotation.
- Added draft-only edit/confirm guardrails, cancellation rules, duplicate-number validation, and deterministic configured numbering for new quotations.
- Published quotation domain events and enqueued workflow jobs for create, update, confirm, cancel, and conversion actions.
- Added a Billing-owned Core lookup proxy for contacts, work orders, products, colours, and sizes; the Quotation browser UI no longer calls Core directly.
- Removed unused quotation form/list duplicates and added Quotation service regression tests for numbering, lifecycle, conversion, events, and queue jobs.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.12.

## v-1.0.11

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.11.

## v-1.0.10

### [v 1.0.10] 2026-07-10 12:00 pm - Core Work Order Module Ownership

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Added the protected Work Order placeholder seed (`WO-0000`) for `work_orders`.
- Aligned master-record protection so global and placeholder records are blocked consistently in update, status, and force-delete flows.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Moved Work Order out of the shared master workspace/list wrappers into module-owned `work-order` workspace, list, form, hooks, services, and definition files.
- Flattened the Work Order form into one owned panel and removed inherited Contact/Product tabs.
- Removed Contact lookup and Contact list column from Work Order so the module no longer feels coupled to Contact master behavior.
- Kept Work Order name and code as edit links for editable rows while protected rows render plain text with the protected indicator.
- Removed Work Order-specific branches from the shared master workspace so future Contact/Product changes do not bleed into Work Order.
- Verified the refactor with Core Web and Platform Web type checks.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.10.

## v-1.0.9

### [v 1.0.9] 2026-07-09 7:53 pm - Billing Settings and Quotation Workflow

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Preserved operator-configured tenant app access during default-tenant boot seeding instead of replacing it with seed defaults.
- Synchronized tenant module settings so disabled and enabled app records remain accurate after provisioning and restart.
- Extended tenant billing settings JSON with shared layout, printing, customisation, feature, and document-numbering defaults.
- Added backward-compatible normalization for legacy per-document layouts and removed obsolete hidden feature and totals settings.
- Added tenant-scoped automatic numbering profiles for Sales, Quotation, Purchase, and Export Sales.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added development-only CODEXSUN tenant auto-login controlled by `.env`, using the normal server-side credential verification and session flow.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.8.

## v-1.0.7

### [v 1.0.7] 2026-07-08 7:28 pm - Database Lifecycle CLI

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Added Platform database lifecycle commands for master and tenant databases: `db:migrate`, `db:seed`, `db:drop`, and `dbmigrate:fresh`.
- Added a Platform API database CLI that reuses the same Kysely migration and seed paths as application startup.
- Added tenant app-module migration and seed passes so registered tenant databases are migrated and seeded from the master tenant registry.
- Added `CODEXSUN_DB_FRESH_ON_START` to optionally drop, recreate, migrate, and seed configured databases during API startup.
- Added destructive action guards: `CODEXSUN_DB_RESET_CONFIRM=DROP_DATABASES`, plus `CODEXSUN_ALLOW_PRODUCTION_DB_RESET=1` when `NODE_ENV=production`.
- Made drop/fresh remove registered tenant databases before dropping the master database.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Simplified the tenant Countries list and editor to show only country name, country code, status, and active control;
  ISO, dial, currency, and sort-order fields remain backend-compatible but are hidden from the tenant frontend.
- Added tenant Country row actions for view, edit, suspend, and guarded force delete, with global country protection.
- Restyled the location Active control as a compact input-height status switch without helper text.
- Fixed bodyless location action requests so Suspend and Force delete are not rejected as empty JSON payloads.
- Replaced generic location duplicate failures with exact name/code conflict messages in the form error banner.
- Simplified the tenant State editor to State name, GST State code, Country, and Active in the same full-width tone as Country.
- Added State view, edit, suspend, and guarded force-delete row actions.
- Added reusable location dependency checks that block force deletion while child location records still reference a parent.
- Applied the finalized full-width master form and row-action pattern to Districts, Cities, and Pincodes.
- Replaced Pincode parent-name inputs with cascading Country, State, District, and City references.
- Enabled editing, suspension, and guarded deletion of seeded District, City, and Pincode rows inside each isolated tenant database.
- Made primary District, City, and Pincode values open Edit directly, removed redundant View actions, and protected the `-` placeholder rows.
- Backfilled seeded Pincodes with Country, State, District, and City IDs so legacy records populate relationship controls and participate in dependency checks.
- Added Tenant-pattern pagination to every location master list with rows-per-page controls, filtered totals, stable row numbering, and page reset on filter changes.
- Applied the finalized master-list pattern to Contact Groups, Contact Types, Address Types, and Bank Names.
- Added protected `-` seeds, editable seeded rows, pagination, clickable names, lifecycle menus, compact Active controls, and force delete for those four masters.
- Seeded Contact Groups with Business and Web Clients, and Contact Types with Customer, Supplier, Vendor Customer, Staff, and Employee.
- Expanded Bank Names from the current RBI directory across public, private, local-area, small-finance, payments, regional-rural, foreign, and state cooperative banks.
- Replaced protected-row text with a shared amber shield indicator and hover tooltip across location and contact masters.
- Extended the finalized protected-row, editable seed, pagination, lifecycle menu, compact Active, and no-sort-order pattern to all Product, Work Order, and Other common masters.
- Added persisted Currency symbols with INR and USD seed backfill, plus reusable missing-column migration support for common masters.
- Converted Months into FY 2026-27 accounting periods with Name, From date, To date, and Active.
- Added loud CLI/startup warnings before destructive database lifecycle actions.
- Added stable migration preflight/list/run/local-test, dump, restore-test, and backup-verification command names.
- Added explicit safety guards for restored-dump migration tests, sandbox restore tests, production backup verification, and backup artifact verification.
- Added database migration, backup, and legacy client migration runbooks plus reusable legacy intake/mapping/validation/cutover templates.
- Documented the baseline backup and restore-test schedule.
- Added console progress logs for database bootstrap, master/tenant database creation, migrations, platform app seeding,
  default tenant seeding, tenant module seeding, tenant admin seed status, and database CLI commands.
- Standardized Platform dev logs so `platform-api` displays as `api` and `platform-web` displays as `web` in stack and
  preflight output.
- Closed tenant database pools after provisioning so one-shot DB commands exit cleanly.
- Documented lifecycle switches in `.env` and `.env.example`.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.7.

## v-1.0.6

### [v 1.0.6] 2026-07-08 7:20 pm - Env Driven Tenant Domain Seed

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Added `DEFAULT_TENANT_DOMAIN` so the test-only default tenant seed stores its primary domain from env.
- Added `TENANT_DOMAIN_BASE` so newly created tenant domains are generated from env instead of a hard-coded `.codexsun.local` suffix.
- Set the local/test default domain values to `localhost` in `.env` and `.env.example` while keeping seed data disabled and blank by default.
- Updated the CODEXSUN auth e2e to verify login through the seeded `localhost` tenant domain.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Removed the remaining hard-coded default tenant domain suffix from Platform API tenant seed/repository paths.
- Added `assist/documentation/project-inventory.md` as the current workspace inventory and latest work update for future agents.
- Linked the project inventory from `assist/README.md` and added it to the recommended reading order.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.6.

## v-1.0.5

### [v 1.0.5] 2026-07-08 7:04 pm - Test-Only Default Tenant Seed

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Moved the default tenant seed behind `ENABLE_DEFAULT_TENANT_SEED=1`.
- Cleared fixed master database, tenant database, DB user, DB password, JWT, and seed user values from `.env` and `.env.example`.
- Made `DEFAULT_TENANT_*` optional for normal runtime and required only when the test seed switch is enabled.
- Kept CODEXSUN seed data inside e2e setup only, with disposable test databases.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Updated the environment helper banner to explain that default tenant values are test-only.
- Updated tenant database e2e setup to explicitly enable and configure the default seed for test runs.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.5.

## v-1.0.4

### [v 1.0.4] 2026-07-08 6:59 pm - Strict Environment Configuration

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Removed runtime fallback database names from Platform, Core, Billing, and database helper code.
- Required `DB_MASTER_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, and `DEFAULT_TENANT_*` values to come from explicit environment configuration.
- Changed the database user helper to read root `.env` and require configured admin/app user credentials and tenant database values.
- Kept e2e database tests isolated by injecting their own disposable environment values.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Added a shared missing/invalid `.env` banner with setup commands: `Copy-Item .env.example .env` and `npm run env:jwt-secret`.
- Removed runtime JWT development-secret fallbacks from Core and Billing APIs.
- Removed hard-coded admin email placeholders from shared UI layouts.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.4.

## v-1.0.3

### [v 1.0.3] 2026-07-08 6:52 pm - CODEXSUN Database Naming Seed

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Changed the default master database name from `codexsun_master_db` to `cxsun_master_db`.
- Changed the default `CODEXSUN` tenant database name from `codexsun_tenant_db` to `codexsun_db`.
- Updated Platform, Core, Billing, setup tooling, and assist architecture references to use the new master database default.
- Kept the default tenant seeder idempotent so first boot creates or updates the `CODEXSUN` tenant with the new tenant database name.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Updated the `CODEXSUN` tenant auth e2e to run against disposable databases using the new naming pattern and verify seed, login, JWT/session, and tenant runtime.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.3.

## v-1.0.2

### [v 1.0.2] 2026-07-08 6:35 pm - Default CODEXSUN Tenant Auth Seed

#### Database Changes

- Database update: Yes (manual).
- Added an idempotent default tenant seed for `CODEXSUN` during Platform API bootstrap.
- Added `.env`-driven default tenant settings: name, corporate ID, slug, tenant database name, and default tenant admin credentials.
- Provisioned the default `CODEXSUN` tenant database with tenant module settings and a tenant-local admin user when `DEFAULT_TENANT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is configured.
- Kept tenant identity database-owned by seeding master tenant and tenant domain rows, with `uuid` used for external JWT/session identity.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Hardened tenant login around the seeded tenant path: Corporate ID + domain resolution, tenant database lookup, tenant-local user verification, signed JWT issue, session verification, and tenant runtime access.
- Added `CODEXSUN` start-to-finish e2e coverage that boots the app, seeds the tenant, logs in, verifies the signed JWT/session, resolves runtime, and cleans up disposable databases.
- Updated platform e2e script to include both tenant database isolation and default tenant auth flows.
- Bumped workspace version to 1.0.2.

## v-1.0.1

### [v 1.0.1] 2026-07-08 2:12 pm - Clean Platform Foundation

#### Database Changes

- Removed copied demo tenant seed data from the Platform API in-memory tenant repository.
- Kept the tenant registry empty by default so the platform starts without fake customer data.
- Kept tenant module persistence as an in-memory foundation only; no production database migration was added in this baseline.

#### App Codebase Changes

- Reduced the copied workspace to the current runnable foundation: `apps/platform/api`, `apps/platform/web`, `packages/framework`, `packages/ui`, and tooling.
- Reorganized Platform Web into a clean source structure:
  - `src/app` for bootstrap, providers, router, and design-system setup.
  - `src/desks` for `/sa`, `/admin`, and `/app` desk shells.
  - `src/modules/tenant` for the tenant frontend module.
  - `src/routes/public` for home, login, and status routes.
  - `src/shared` for API client, auth gate, and document title helpers.
- Removed the old `src/pages` dumping area, copied super-admin pages, template pages, design-system demo page, and stale tenant pages.
- Added the first standard Platform API module under `apps/platform/api/src/modules/tenant` using the required module file pattern:
  - `tenant.module.ts`
  - `tenant.service.ts`
  - `tenant.repository.ts`
  - `tenant.routes.ts`
  - `tenant.events.ts`
  - `tenant.migration.ts`
  - `tenant.worker.ts`
  - `tenant.seed.ts`
  - `tenant.sync.ts`
  - `tenant.test.ts`
  - `tenant.types.ts`
  - `index.ts`
- Updated the module-boundary checker to validate the current one-folder, module-prefixed file standard instead of the older folder-heavy pattern.
- Replaced the Platform Web API client with a local envelope-aware fetch client.
- Simplified Platform API auth/session routes into a development foundation without fake tenant records.
- Cleaned `/`, `/sa`, `/admin`, `/app`, and `/status` so they no longer show demo tenant names, fake databases, fake users, scaffold labels, or copied product claims.
- Removed unimplemented future module choices from tenant setup; tenant access now only guarantees `platform.tenant`.
- Removed copied API JSON registries, old e2e references, invalid database scripts, and stale Playwright config.
- Removed unused demo dashboard blocks and fake menu defaults from `packages/ui`.
- Pruned copied public/design/print CSS from Platform Web and kept only styles used by the current routes.
- Set Vite cache under the root dependency tree and kept a single root `node_modules`.
- Kept build output collected under the root `dist/` packaging surface.
- Verified the cleaned foundation with:
  - `npm.cmd run check`
  - `npm.cmd run build`
  - route smoke checks for `/`, `/sa`, `/admin`, `/app`, and `/status`.
