# Framework Foundation

## Purpose

`@cxsun/framework` is the shared technical backbone for CODEXSUN apps.

It must stay business-rule free. Platform, Core, business apps, and industry packs own product behavior.

## Current Framework Scope

The first framework package provides:

- Fastify API app bootstrap.
- Cookie and CORS registration convention.
- Standard response envelope helpers.
- App error type and API error handler.
- Environment loading through Zod.
- Structured log shape helper.
- MySQL/MariaDB connection contract.
- Module registry.
- Typed module composition through `defineModule()` and `registerModules()`.
- Domain event contract and in-memory development publisher.
- Queue job contract and in-memory development adapter.
- Storage adapter contract.
- Runtime health check runner and health route helper.
- Zod-backed route contracts that validate inputs and successful response data.

## Module Composition Standard

Every runnable module is composed through `defineModule<TDependencies>()` and exposes a
`register(dependencies)` function. Its dependencies are explicit, typed, and supplied
only by the application composition root. Modules must not reach into another module's
singleton or create hidden application-level dependencies.

```ts
export const ordersModule = defineModule<OrdersModuleDependencies>({
  key: "billing.orders",
  label: "Orders",
  register: ({ app, orderService }) => registerOrderRoutes(app, orderService)
});
```

Use `registerModules()` in the runnable app to reject duplicate module keys and provide
one observable lifecycle for module registration.

## Route Contract Standard

New or materially changed API routes use `registerContractRoute()`. A route contract
must declare Zod schemas for all inputs it accepts (`body`, `params`, and/or
`querystring`) and for its successful `response` data. The framework parses inputs
before the handler runs, validates response data before it is sent, and wraps success
responses in the standard envelope. Invalid input becomes the standard
`VALIDATION_ERROR` response; handlers use `AppError` for expected business failures.

```

## Boundary Rules

- Framework may enforce technical conventions.
- Framework must not contain tenant, subscription, billing, accounting, industry, or permission business rules.
- App modules should use framework contracts instead of direct queue, event, storage, or API boot implementations.
- Platform-specific migrations and seeders remain outside framework.

## Next Framework Work

- Add test helpers for Fastify inject.
- Add request correlation ID middleware.
- Add tenant context request type helpers after Platform tenant resolution is formalized.
- Add Kysely connection wrapper after database schema types are introduced.
- Add real queue adapters after local Docker/Redis stage.
- Add outbox helpers after event persistence tables are introduced.
