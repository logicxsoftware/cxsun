# Environments

## Purpose

CODEXSUN should have clear environments so development, testing, demos, and production work do not interfere with each other.

## Environment Types

### Local

Used by developers and CODEIT.

Purpose:

- Fast development.
- Module testing.
- Local tenant data.
- Local containers.
- Offline simulation.

### Development

Shared internal environment.

Purpose:

- Feature integration.
- Internal testing.
- Early API and UI validation.

### Staging

Production-like environment.

Purpose:

- Release candidate testing.
- Migration testing.
- Integration testing.
- Performance checks.
- Demo validation.

### Production

Customer environment.

Purpose:

- Live tenant operations.
- Business records.
- Compliance workflows.
- Real integrations.

### Sandbox

Customer or internal test environment.

Purpose:

- Customer training.
- Integration trials.
- Feature preview.
- Safe experimentation.

## Environment Rules

- Production data must not be copied to lower environments without masking sensitive data.
- Credentials must be different per environment.
- External integrations must have sandbox mode where possible.
- AI tools must clearly know the current environment.
- Logs must identify environment.
- Migrations should be tested before production.

## Configuration Rules

Configuration should include:

- Environment name.
- Database targets.
- Queue targets.
- File storage targets.
- Integration credentials.
- Feature flags.
- AI model settings.
- Logging level.
- Support access rules.

Secrets must not be committed to source control.

CODEXSUN keeps development and container deployment inputs separate so both
can run in parallel. Root `.env` is local development configuration documented
by `.env.example`. `.container/deploy.env` is the private production/container
configuration built from `.container/deploy.env.sample`. Container Compose,
migrations, updates, cleanup metadata, and smoke tests must read only the
deployment file. Environment variables must be validated before startup.
Cloud operators prepare that file with `bash prepare-env.sh`; `bash setup.sh`
only checks and consumes it. Setup must never create deployment configuration
or offer to copy values or credentials from development `.env`.

All application-owned environment variables use the `CXSUN_*` prefix. The
retired prefix has no runtime alias: root and deployment environment files must
be migrated together before startup. Public branding values such as the
CODEXSUN display name and `app.codexsun.com` remain values, not configuration
names or internal namespaces.

Platform runtime configuration keeps only the API port, Web port, and canonical
Web origin as developer inputs. Platform derives loopback bind addresses for
development/test, all-interface bind addresses for staging/production, the
server-to-server API URL from the API port, and local host/CORS aliases from
the canonical Web origin. Product packages consume those derived Platform
runtime contracts instead of defining duplicate host or URL variables.
