# Tenant Isolation

## Goal

Every tenant must behave like a separate customer environment even when multiple tenants share the same codebase, app servers, containers, or infrastructure.

## Isolation Levels

CODEXSUN should support multiple isolation patterns:

- Dedicated database per tenant.
- Shared infrastructure with strict tenant routing.
- Dedicated containers for high-value or regulated tenants.
- Local offline store per tenant on desktop or mobile.

The default planning assumption is one database per tenant where business isolation, backup, restore, or customization requires it.

## Tenant Context

`CXSUN_TENANCY_MODE` selects `single` or `multi` when Platform starts. Both modes
retain the tenant registry, tenant database, signed tenant session, and request-bound
database routing. In `single` mode, `CXSUN_SINGLE_TENANT_CORPORATE_ID` identifies the
only active registered tenant. Startup rejects a missing, different, or additional
tenant. Tenant login and password recovery bind to this identity without asking for
Corporate ID; requests cannot select another tenant. Tenant creation and suspension
are disabled. In `multi` mode, tenant login requires Corporate ID and continues to
validate any custom-domain mapping. Change the mode only as a deployment operation
after checking the registry and backing up the data; it is not a live user switch.

Tenant context should include:

- Tenant ID.
- Tenant slug or code.
- Tenant database connection target.
- Active subscription.
- Active industry pack.
- Active apps and features.
- Locale and compliance settings.
- User role and permission scope.

Current implementation note: tenant login resolves the tenant database for tenant user authentication, and Core business requests require a validated `x-tenant-db` context. Core rejects the Platform master database and routes repositories through the request-bound tenant database connection. Core Common master tables therefore do not duplicate tenant identity in `tenant_id` columns; the selected database is their isolation boundary.

Platform requires an active server session for both cookie and bearer requests. After validating the session and tenant registry, Platform replaces tenant routing headers and sets tenant response metadata from that trusted context. The shared Framework never derives response metadata from an incoming `x-tenant-id` header.

Tenant database provisioning follows the tenant's selected application set. Platform identity/access migrations run
first. Billing activation then runs Core's owned prerequisite migrations and seeds before Billing's owned migrations
and seeds. Mail migrations run only when Mail is enabled. Task Manager runs its own migrations and seeds when enabled. Tenant
create/update and managed setup, reinstall, and migration actions use this same ordered composition contract.
Managed lifecycle actions invalidate only the target tenant's Core and Billing bootstrap state before running, so a
database recreated while the API process remains online receives the complete selected-app schema.

Tenant context must be available in:

- HTTP requests.
- WebSocket events.
- Queue jobs.
- Domain events.
- Scheduled tasks.
- Sync payloads.
- Audit logs.
- AI tool calls.
- Integration calls.

Tenant context may be resolved from custom domain, subdomain, path fallback, or explicit headers depending on client and app surface. Production tenant web should primarily use custom domain or subdomain. Path fallback is reserved for development, internal tools, and Super Admin support flows. Jobs and events must always carry tenant ID explicitly.

Application tenant resolution only needs domain-to-tenant mapping. SSL certificates, DNS, Cloudflare, Nginx, and reverse proxy concerns belong to infrastructure.

Production rule: after domain/subdomain resolution is implemented, the request host must bind the tenant first. Headers may carry the already-resolved tenant ID to APIs, but they must not be treated as an independent source of truth for tenant identity.

## Data Access Rules

- No tenant business data access without tenant context.
- No global query should accidentally read tenant data.
- Tenant user sessions must not be able to access another tenant by changing request headers.
- Shared tables that temporarily store tenant business data must include tenant ownership filters.
- Dedicated tenant database routing must fail closed when the tenant database mapping is missing, inactive, or not ready.
- Background jobs must restore tenant context before work starts.
- Integration callbacks must resolve tenant context safely.
- Reporting must respect tenant and permission boundaries.
- AI assistants must not access data outside the current tenant or approved support scope.

## Multi-Company Scope

One tenant may own many companies. Company, branch, warehouse, counter, device, accounting year, GST identity, document numbering, and default-company selection must remain inside the tenant boundary. Cross-company views are allowed only inside the same tenant and only through permission-aware workflows. Cross-tenant company access is never allowed.

## Customization Rules

Tenant customization should be stored as structured configuration:

- Enabled apps.
- Enabled features.
- UI preferences.
- Print templates.
- Numbering formats.
- Tax settings.
- Workflow settings.
- Custom fields.
- Integration credentials.

Customizations must be versioned when they affect data shape, billing logic, accounting, or compliance output.

## Backup And Restore

Each tenant should have a planned backup and restore strategy:

- Full database backup.
- File storage backup.
- Configuration backup.
- Audit trail retention.
- Restore testing.
- Point-in-time recovery where possible.

The Super Admin Tenant Databases workspace can create and download SQL backups for one selected
tenant. It also accepts SQL files created by this application for that tenant's current database.
Uploaded files are checked before they are stored in the tenant's private backup folder. A restore
requires a selected completed backup file and an explicit Fresh or Append choice. Both modes target
that tenant's separate restore sandbox; neither mode changes the live tenant database. Fresh
replaces the sandbox contents after a staging restore, while Append inserts rows into an existing
sandbox and rolls back on conflicts. Backup downloads, uploads, and restore requests are restricted
to Super Admin and checked against the selected tenant ID and database name.

## Security Notes

- Tenant database credentials should not be exposed to clients.
- API tokens must be tenant-scoped.
- External integration credentials must be encrypted.
- Support access must be audited.
- Cross-tenant admin actions need elevated permission and logging.

## Domain And Login Resolution

The canonical production host is `app.codexsun.com`. It is a shared entry point and
does not belong to any one tenant. Tenant login on this host resolves an exact
Corporate ID, verifies that tenant is active, resolves its server-side database
secret, verifies the user in that tenant database, and only then creates a
tenant-bound session.

Custom domains are optional mappings. They start disabled and pending, become
active only after DNS TXT ownership verification. The verified host narrows tenant
resolution, but it never replaces Corporate ID: every tenant login must supply an
exact Corporate ID matching the tenant mapped to that host. Host mappings and
session claims are rechecked on protected requests.

Tenant, company, financial year, landing page, enabled modules, and safe settings
may be cached for the current login. The cache is never an authorization source
and is cleared whenever the browser principal changes.
