# UI Form Regression Guardrails

These rules exist because tenant/common/master form changes recently caused avoidable runtime and UX failures. Treat this file as a strict checklist before changing shared form controls, common modules, relation lookups, switch cards, or tenant/master upsert pages.

## Problems We Must Not Repeat

1. Placeholder text returned after restart.
   - Cause: hardcoded `placeholder` values remained in field definitions and shared input/autocomplete defaults.
   - Risk: the UI looks clean during one manual test but comes back after reload because another shared path still forwards placeholders.

2. Foreign relations showed raw ids.
   - Cause: fields like `countryId`, `stateId`, and `districtId` were rendered as plain inputs/list cells.
   - Risk: users see meaningless ids, type invalid values, and create broken relation data.

3. Nested interactive elements caused React warnings.
   - Cause: a clickable switch card was implemented as a `<button>` containing the Radix `Switch`, which is also a button.
   - Risk: hydration warnings, invalid HTML, broken keyboard behavior, and e2e console failures.

4. Autocomplete ref/update loop.
   - Cause: a portal/ref-heavy lookup was reused inside common dialogs and triggered `Maximum update depth exceeded`.
   - Risk: the route crashes and React recreates the tree.

5. Optional props broke strict typecheck.
   - Cause: passing `undefined` directly to optional props under `exactOptionalPropertyTypes`.
   - Risk: unrelated forms fail to compile after small UI changes.

6. Visual alignment changed without full form checks.
   - Cause: individual rows were adjusted without checking all similar rows: communication, address, bank, social, tax.
   - Risk: one row is fixed while another form section remains misaligned.

7. E2E helpers typed old id values into fields that became autocompletes.
   - Cause: test helpers were not updated when relation fields changed from text inputs to lookup inputs.
   - Risk: tests pass for the wrong behavior or fail later in unrelated modules.

## Strict Implementation Rules

1. No hardcoded placeholders in tenant/common/master form inputs.
   - Do not add `placeholder: "..."` in tenant field definitions.
   - Do not forward field placeholder values from generic form renderers.
   - Shared autocomplete/lookup defaults must be blank unless a specific page has an approved reason.

2. Relation fields must be autocomplete fields.
   - Any field ending in `Id` that references another common/master table must show a name label in the UI.
   - The saved payload may store the id, but list/detail/form display must show the related name when available.
   - Examples:
     - `countryId` -> label `Country`, autocomplete `countries`
     - `stateId` -> label `State`, autocomplete `states`
     - `districtId` -> label `District`, autocomplete `districts`
     - product fields -> Product Type, HSN Code, Unit, GST names/rates

3. Switch cards must not be buttons wrapping switches.
   - Use a non-button wrapper with `role="button"` and keyboard handling.
   - The switch itself may remain interactive.
   - Whole card click must toggle.
   - Active/on card is green.
   - Inactive/off card is grey.
   - Height must match normal inputs (`h-11`).

4. Avoid portal/ref-heavy lookups inside generic dialogs unless tested.
   - For dialog relation fields, prefer a local dropdown or a component proven not to create ref update loops.
   - Any lookup replacement must be tested with create, edit, clear, inline create, and reopen dialog.

5. With exact optional props, only pass optional props when defined.
   - Use `{...(value ? { prop: value } : {})}`.
   - Do not pass `prop={maybeUndefined}` unless the prop type explicitly includes `undefined`.

6. Form row alignment must be checked by section.
   - If one switch/input row is aligned, check every comparable row in the same form.
   - Required sections for contact/product/common changes:
     - Details
     - Tax Details
     - Communication
     - Addresses
     - Finance
     - More
     - Generic common dialog

7. E2E must match the real control type.
   - Text inputs can be filled by index only when the form is stable and simple.
   - Lookup fields must be tested by visible name, not by raw numeric/id fallback.
   - Inline create should be covered for at least one lookup field in the tenant flow.

## Required Test Commands

Run these after any shared form, common module, master module, lookup, switch, layout, or button change:

```bash
npm run check
npm run build
npm run test:e2e:composed-runtime
```

For a faster first pass during active development:

```bash
npm run typecheck -w @cxsun/platform-web
npm run lint -w @cxsun/platform-web
```

Complete browser verification against the root `npm run dev` runtime when the
change affects interaction or layout behavior.

## Manual Smoke Checklist

Use this checklist when reviewing in browser:

1. Open a common module with relations:
   - Countries
   - States
   - Districts
   - Cities
2. Create/edit each relation record using names in autocomplete.
3. Confirm list columns show names, not ids.
4. Restart dev server or refresh browser.
5. Confirm placeholders do not return.
6. Toggle Active card by clicking:
   - the switch
   - the card body
   - keyboard Enter/Space
7. Confirm inactive card is grey and active card is green.
8. Watch browser console:
   - no `Maximum update depth exceeded`
   - no nested `<button>` warnings
   - no 403 except intentional tenant mismatch e2e checks

## Review Rule

Do not mark a tenant/common/master form task complete unless:

- the relevant relation fields are name-based autocompletes,
- no hardcoded placeholder is visible,
- switch cards match the shared behavior,
- typecheck passes,
- tenant e2e passes,
- and full platform e2e passes when a shared component changed.
